Heading,Review
Good Novel to Read,"The three mistakes of my life is one of the best novel  i have read. It is a story of 3 childhood friends that in future opens a shop as they were unemployed. In this novel Govind is the narrator who tells his three mistakes of his life to famous writer CHETAN BHAGAT and the author knewed about this book as he has read a suicide mail that was send to the author. The 3 childhood friends i.e. (Omi, Ishaan, Govind ) opens a shop of cricket products as ishaan is fond of cricket. He remained a good cricketer of his time in his city. A small overview i have given else u can buy the book and explore more. From my side it's a good book."
Review after finishing the book,"Hey,have just completed the novel. Yes, this book has the power to amusement like a real story.As written on the backside of the book by the author this is really filled with religious,politics,calamities,unacceptable love and the great mistakes.Purely loved with this book and thank you @Chetan for this piece."
Another Bhagat classic,"The reason for me to read this book was to compare it with the movie ""kai po che"" and how it was portrayed after being adapted from the book.I felt the ending to this book could have been better considering the epilogue was very predictable"
Awsome book,Once I started reading it I couldn't stop reading it untill I finished reading it.The story is a happy ending story as Govind says.I loved this book.This is a must read book!
Must read book,Good one...really this too can be made as a movie...interesting one which I completed reading in 2 days..became fan of this author..
Nice book,Nice book. Thanks for Amazon for the service.
Average,The book has touched some nice points ...The best part is when Ali refuses Australian Governments scholarship offer and wanted to play for India only
Uninspiring,"Picked the book coz I kind of liked the movie. Must say the language is average, the characters all sound the same and some things just don't add up. Watch the movie instead."

great book,"great written by Chetan Bhagat, specially for younger... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. .."
best book for the cricket lovers,"Its the BEST BOOK of CHETAN BHAGAT ever written. I loved the book because it had a story of three friends{ Govind,Ish, omi }  and their passion.The narrator of the book is govind patel, who tells the story of his own 3 mistakes to CHETAN BHAGAT. Based on real events, from the bestselling author CHETAN BHAGAT, comes another dark, witty tale about modern india, where the author brings about the ethos and isolation of an entire generation to the fore."
3 MISTAKES.,"The book is interesting with easy flowing style. Chetan has intelligently woven a story with cricket as background. He knew that millions of Indians are crazy about cricket game. He has found a ready bank of customers. Some parts of the story may look unbelievable but a fiction is a fiction. He has touched communal clashes, cricket and a little bit of love angle bordering on sex to captivate the readers. It is overall a good book.  Mangalam Shiva."
my view on the awesome book.,"hey amazon,I think 'the 3 mistakes of my life' is an awesome book.Its really cool to read it.Its fantastic how Chetan bhagat capture people's mind .thank you amazon for the book."
Climax = hero,"The storyline was pretty mundane at the beginning. Just ya-da ya-da for about half the book.THEN the story begun becoming interesting, intriguing and exciting. The suspense level was brought up to the maximum and towards the end of the book, my eyes opened wider and wider, heart raced faster and faster. The climax was sooo thrilling.The hero of the story was towards the end.Ah, couldn't stop reading. LOVED IT!!"
Review,"This is the first book i'm reading in my life . I bought this book with no hope how it will be . After reading , i love this story and CHETAN BHAGAT way of telling this story. I would like to buy this author books . Now ordering REVOLUTION 2020 ."
Good One!!!,"Received in good condition !! Started reading... But then got into PS3, so got shelved... need to continue reading. Have read it long back on a train journey from Pune to Chennai but didn't complete it. So went on buying this one for my own. Thanks to Amazon n Seller!"
Awesome book from Chetan Bhagat,"This is my first book and I am super excited to read the book. Not yet read, as I didn't get any time. But for sure, its gonna be an awesome one from chetan bhagat as I heard a very complimentary messages from my friends as they are the followers of chetan bhagat. So will update you after reading this one."
A good catch.,"This book is a perfect combination of friendship, money, love, lust and affection. It's actually for Indians.I am a big CB fan and strongly believe that he is the best thing which could've ever happened to India in form of a writer. Truly unafraid leader of 21st century India."
Expectations exceeded!,"Really exceeded my expectations. This was the first time I was reading the work of Chetan Bhagat and gotta hand it to the guy, loved the way he writes. He get in deep into the story making it feel more alive while still keeping it simple. Great job"
must read it,"Nice book.Chethan Bhagat wrote in simple manner,i didn't feel bore at all.I completed in 5 days in my exam days!"
Enjoyed every bit of it.....superb narration....,"I have just completed this book. Yes, this book has the power to amusement like a real story.As written on the backside of the book by the author this is really filled with religious,politics,calamities,unacceptable love and the great mistakes.Purely loved with this book and thank you chetan sir for this piece."
Awesome Book,I was very fond of reading novels from my young age.i have just given my 10th std boards exams.i just wanted to give a try reading novels in summers.So i say to the new readers that give a start by reading this novel written by chetan bhagat.I founded this book very realistic as if everything is happening in front of u.Overall an awesome book.Dont think a lot whether to purchase it or not? Give it a try.GO FOR IT.THANK U AMAZON FOR SUCH A GREAT BOOK.
... think so since the front cover and pages looks like a older one,"The book I received was the old one I think so since the front cover and pages looks like a older one, but as the whole the book was in good condition."
Five Stars,super
Good but not as good as other Chetan Bhagat books,"This book is good for leisure time reading but if you are expecting it to be as spicy as the other Chetan Bhagat books, then it may disappoint you."
I Like It,Good Story To Read . nice Book to say .Best Book By Chetan Sir . . . . !
Full of Emotions. A good read!,"interesting read, story keeps the reader connected and curious to read further. finished it in three sittings. one of bhagat's best novels."
Very good book,I bought Rs 100/- Only ..Good Book.It's a very much different than other storys and every reader Fun to read the book and easy to understand thanks amazon for this e book.
Good read,I was suspicious before starting the book. But after reading the same I found it very interesting and when we read it we meet the contemporary society of youth.  No one can say that writer is new age Premchand but it least he is giving something to which new generation relates.
Worth buying,A good product with high quality sound and good performace. Gets easily connected to android and apple phones. It is the best bluetooth device within its range of price.
Poor book,"Its boring as hell , as the protagonist said not to write about him , chetan did it and he paid for making a mistake even me too , poor book God ,,"
Good book,Chetan Baghat is an good author.... I read the 2 states and it was nice read .... then I ordered this one ... this one is good
Best book for beginner level book readers,"Nice book for beginner level book readers easy and understandable words , Good story and unpredictable twists emotional climax......."
Fabulous one!!!,"This is my 3rd book I have ever read of Chetan Bhagat series. And I like the way of narrating. Love romance friendship, a complete amalgamation of all the things at a single platform that will bring you extreme cheer. Fabulous!!!"
Amazon cheated,I ordered this book and I received wings of fire. Amazon cheated me. I paid through net banking. Be careful.
Five Stars,I love the book
Four Stars,It's amazing book. Everyone should purchase it and read it. Padhega india tabhi to baghega India.

Four Stars,Bad page quality
Five Stars,Amazing?
The book is definitely worth your time and money..,"What strikes you first about Chetan Bhagat’s novels is the fact that this author writes about Indians and for Indians. His characters are young, ambitious and passionate and have the same moral, social and religious dilemmas as many of the young Indians today. At the same time their context and sensibility too is unabashedly Indian. The new and the third Bhagat book, “The 3 mistakes of my life”, has all these qualities.The setting is the city of Ahmedabad that though being urban is yet not as metropolitan as many of its metro counterparts. It retains its small town flavour in pols (colonies), traditional Indian households and small vegetarian eateries. It has the protagonist Govind with his passion and acumen for accounts and business, it has Ishan for whom cricket is the element around which his life revolves and it has Omi, a priest’s son and loyal friend who is ready for anything that his friends are game for.The book is based on real life events. It begins in a dramatic enough fashion with Bhagat receiving an e-mail from Govind who had taken many sleeping pills and was writing to him while waiting for the deadly sleep’s embrace. Chetan was shaken enough by the incident to track the boy down to an Ahmedabad hospital. Fortunately he was still alive to tell the tale. The book is loosely based on the three mistakes Govind made in his life.What follows is a mix of cricket, religion, business, love and friendship. Govind sets up a sports shop along with his friends in the temple compound with Omi’s family’s help. The shop prospers as Ishan coaches young boys in cricket and Govind teaches maths to Ishan’s sister Vidya who also captures his heart. Ishan then meets Ali, a child master with a hyper reflex condition that makes him hit each ball for a six. Ali displays the talent which Ishan never had and Ali’s destiny becomes his own.Enter Omi’s Bitoo mama (maternal uncle), a communal party man bent on converting the young into fighters in the name of Hinduism. Situations come to a head and Ahmedabad burns in riot fires. Omi dies saving Ali and Ishan finds out about Vidya and Govind, a betrayal he does not forgive. These events lead Govind to his death-bed and that is when he writes the email to Bhagat.Perhaps, this is the biggest compliment an author can receive. Its not when New York Times describes him as the biggest selling English language author in the country or when he crosses the coveted two million book sales’ figure, but when someone chooses to remember him in his last minutes, that makes a writer go beyond the ordinary. After all, isn’t the purpose of all writing is to touch someone’s heart?“The 3 mistakes of my life” is written simply and has the quality that makes one want to read the book cover to cover in one sitting. The pricing of the book is just right for the target audience - young people. This book like Bhagat’s earlier one, “One night @ call centre, too has the masala, emotion and pace to turn into a potential blockbuster.Just got this book one day before date of delivery,awesome book must read it.Thanks to amazon as my collection of chetan bhagat's books has been completed. Awesome service by amazon, Thank you so much....Amazon..."
really very cool story,"the story is really interesting. chetan bhagat book lovers ...plzz read this  book. the most  sespencious part was when bitto mama comes to kill ali and all the three, that is, govind, ishaan and omi try to save him"
the best,"its the only book which made me cry at the end. its a story of friendship love and yeah mistakes. its truly interesting. takes you to the edge of the seat. i still cant get over the story. it has aspects of life mistakes, religion, friendship, and love. one of the must read books of chetan bhagat. please do read it. its really fantabulous."
A very good one to read!,"A story that was going on in the background of religious enemity, with three friends fighting together for their young friend ali. A story based on the weak and strong emotions of human mind."
Worth Reading,"My first violence genre, felt like it would be nice if there is a sequel..!!! The nature of the novel is really awesome."
i fell in love with this book,"This is the book that I can say I have found the authors work on my palm. But I can surely assure that its one of the very interesting book that anyone can go deep into. So interestingly narrated, touched out my heart"
Not much worth to spend time,"When compared with other books, its not that much attractive. Sometimes had to turn page cause paid for this book. Even if it shows Indian society a bit, fed up with too much violence. Nothing much to say as page turner. Felt like wasted the time. I would suggest five point someone and Revolution 2020 that this book."
A tad exaggerative,"The book uses real life incidents to stitch together a rather griping narrative. Some of the coincidences are ""over the top"" though."
"Like any CB book, filmy.",As everyone knows CB books will always be filmy. Not a bad and not a great.  18+ recommended... So I didn't like it much. But it's my opinion. Read it with your interest and not any reviews.
Nice book...,Its a very nice book because it is so intersting and informatery.i want to suggest every youth. They must read this book. i'm sure you will learn many things. And specially i suggest this book to youngester who belongs to villages and small towns...
Good!,I like the vocabulary used in this book. I didn't like the 2nd mistake of his life cause there is over exaggeration in those chapters. At the end everything ends well. It was great reading this book.:)
"Nice book for the youngsters based on politics,cricket and religion...","This book had many elements in its story like religion,politics,cricket and romance. This was exciting to read."
just okay,Okay. Just okay. Better reads are there for good readers.
Cluster of indian movies,"Lot of things put together in a book romance, friendship, betrayal , religious . It is like Indian meal . Ending as expected .good to read"
Great,Enthusiastic while reading.Could be involved in the story's stream.What a great stories Chetan picks are always exclamatory. Good to read the book
Super,"Very good book, Author had written story from religion,business,sports,love and education perspectives."
Chetoon's Adventures,"The usual plot of underage pubertical sex and fantasies. Except for some good portions and plots, the entire reading experience is cringeworthy."
Beautiful book,"Like this book as it contain a good story, narrated beautifully. Ups and downs of the story kept me busy."
Elongated,I think it is lagged at some places. But over all i enjoyed it.I recommend this book to read for time pass rather for knowlege
Tragic ending,Chetan does not this type of book this is not his style. I personally don't like the tragic end :( . Would not recommend this book to any one.
Average read,Didn't find it interesting. Slow moving initially and very fast moving in the end. His love stories are better I feel
Enjoyed reading a book after a long time,I almost wanted to find out if it was fiction or non-fiction !! It was gripping and well narrated at the same time..
Good Time Pass,"Overall, It's a quite decent book. It keeps you engaged very well. I have read two books of Chetan Bhagat and they both are nice."
really nice book,You will be amazed to know that I completed this book in just two days .. as it was a really thrillling kind of book .. loved it
good,Good

Amazing Story,I loved this story and would recommend it to friends too. Great story by Chetan Bhagat one of my favourite author :))
Four Stars,Good
"A Great Blend of Cricket, Religion and Politics","‘The 3 Mistakes of My Life’ is my favorite novel by Chetan Bhagat. This novel successfully incorporates three important aspects of you India that most Indians are passionate about - cricket, religion and politics. Set against the backdrop of Gujarat, Chetan Bhagat spins a charming story through a set of young and idealistic youngsters - Omi, Govind and Ishan."
Awesome book,Nice book
You will feel bored while reading as I did,"You will feel bored while reading as I did. I even skipped a few pages because I got bored! hell ya! it could have been much better. I didn't like the title (though the cover was good), the way the story has been framed..and what were those mistakes, just asking? :p"

after reading this book one thing is confirm that some ...,after reading this book one thing is confirm that some people's heart is so big that even they forgive us if we do big mistakes some may even kill us for that reason so never commit this type of mistake
Great book.,General questions of people:• What was the first mistake?-Paying advance for the shop in the Mall..Read and find out the other two mistakes. Great book.
This book wasn't a mistake..,"It is a great book. More than a book it is more of a movie types. It has cricket, business, drama, riots and friends. It is a book worth buying. One of Chetan Bhagat's best.."
novel,"As usually narration is good.I had read the description before ordering, i felt it will be great but it didnt meet my expectations. But its ok"
This is my firstbok..really good,Good ...very good book for new readers...This is my firstbok..really good. Will read one more book of chetan bagat. It impressed so much
thanks to mr chetan bhagat for pesting lime to my pocket...,a very nice book...by an author for the younger in india...it gives direction to them..n shares his views...about xxx
Awesome Write,Very Different from what was shown in the movie.. All the characters are aptly written. I must read for everyone
