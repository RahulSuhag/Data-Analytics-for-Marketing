"Trust me you wont regret (from a 15 day heavy, rough, reckless user. )","Its worth every penny you spent. The camera is awesome but dont start comparing it with pixel 2 XL or iPhone x. Because remember you are paying half the price of those phones. The screen looks awesome and very vibrant despite being only a 1080p display unless you are using a VR headset. Low light photography is actually improved. Build quality is pretty good, feels premium. Dont ask about the performance, its just a killer in that section. I pretty use my phone to a extreme limit like playing music,games,messaging,downloading all that stuff simultaneously & the phone executes it like a piece of cake. Im impressed by how it handles multitasking. As of now its been 15 days & still no heating issues so far. Watching videos in this device feels awesome, seriously 18:9 aspect ratio makes you love your phone even more. And yeah! the dash charging surely it really helps you during emergency, once you use it then you will understand the love that I have for dash charging. Only thing that I wished in this phone was IP certification for water resistance, but hold on the other day my little brother slipped my phone into the water bucket then after drying out all the water from my phone(using hair dryer) voila it was back to its original state. But please dont start experimenting with this device because it doesnt recommend water resistant certification but still it gives you some amount of protection toward splashing which is really a good thing. If i have got to recommend anybody to buy a best phone(2017) which covers all the spectrum then my friend this is the phone. Trust me you wont regret (from a 15 day heavy, rough, reckless user. )"
Five Stars,Awesome...just love it....and thanks to amazon for super fast delivery.
One plus 5t just a good mobile,"Good mobile but dont expect miracles from it if ur not social networking user or student coz in that case It will just a mobile with good displayPrevious Mobile Mi Note4I miss d Mi UIOP5T#Camera is pretty good#Processor is good#No heating issues#A full charge can give u 1.5days for average userDash charger is boon for father like me whosChild not give enough time for charging ,?#front camera is also good#slim n easy to handle with one hand n lightweight#display is good but not exceptional#finger print recognition is not that good as mi note 4#face recognition was very fast at some point in low light but sometimes doesnt recognise in bright light not expected from OP"
Heavenly.,"The OxygenOs is an absolute treat to use. The phone is faster than ever. The YouTube videos regarding its face unlock cannot be more true. It packs a strong processor with more than enough amount of RAM enabling high performance and multitasking. The battery is not so great though the accuracy of dash charging compensates for it. The gameplay is absolutely phenomenal. The rainbow reflection some people were talking about is hardly noticeable. The camera is top-notch. Be it dark light photography, portrait mode, pro mode or documents, its results are extremely satisfying. The fingerprint scanner is at a very comfortable position and the display adds to its aesthetic build.However, i expect an Oreo update soon."
"As they say in The Office, A Win-Win-Win scenario","First of all, I am using the phone for about 3 weeks now and my initial conclusions are provided below. However, I think a little background will be helpful for some perspective.I was eagerly waiting for the Galaxy A8+ to launch and was 90% sure about buying it, mainly of the points I am about to mention:#1 Camera is recessed from the back plane and not protruding outwards. This is a big deal for me.#2 IP certification, which we don’t know will be needed or not but having it doesn’t hurt.#3 Service quality is definitely better, at least in terms of presence.But the following facts veered me towards 5T:#1 There are three things you need to know about Oxygen is. It’s fast, fast and super fast. I certainly am enjoying this right now.#2  Samsung A8+ looks ugly. It’s as simple as that. But maybe that’s just me.#3 Dash charge. Read about it. It boggled my mind that other manufacturers don’t do this. I am sorry I can’t explain to you about this elaborately in this forum but if you are serious, go google. The speed is insane, yes, but the concept and execution by one plus even better still.The phone is super fast, screen is insane, guaranteed second look and positive reactions by others about the phone. I didn’t know face unlock could be that fast. Again, have to experience it. Even the youtube videos that I saw can’t justify it. The phone charging I have already talked about and the battery is also pretty good. I can go on and on but other users have already covered a great deal about this. I definitely am super satisfied and would recommend it to my friends blindly.But just as important are the ones that I am about to mention:#1  The camera protruding is a bit of an issue for me as I wear jeans and ride bike on a daily basis, and other users have posted pictures that show dust under the camera lens. It won’t be visible when checked daily but you look closely at it after a year’s use and Wham! it’s got scratches. It certainly did with my HTC and I am pretty sure it happens to all brands. I just wish all manufacturers used the Sony Ericsson K810i as their model.#2 The charger provided in India ranges from 200-240 volts, so low voltage and international compatibility can be an issue.#3 I really would have liked the option of external memory. It’s not a matter of storage issue as much as a security/convenience issue. You can pretty much take out the card and lend the phone to others, or don’t have to copy everything when upgrading. Or to transfer data, just take out the card and lend it to others without having to lend the phone itself.In conclusion, I am happy I bought the 5T and I was proven right by one plus team. I mean, Oreo in a flagship :) , not that I will be upgrading anytime soon."
Best features with nominal pricing,"A great phone which can easily compete with i phone x.I am writing this review after using it for 2 weeksPros: 1.Very sleak design, light weight and metallic finish takes the phone to a whole next level. 2.Processor, which never hangs in any of the complicated apps that you may use.3. Camera quality is one of its USP.4. Dash charging can get a 75% charge, just in 15 mins from 0% battery.5. Face recognition is working absolutely fine and touch sensor at back is neatly made.Cons:1. Battery gets drained within 8 hrs, with a normal usage.2. The phone gets heated to an extent.Overall, its one of the best phones to invest, without much research reqd."
EXCELLENT WITH THIS PRICE :),"FROM 2012 I AM USING ANDROID MOBILES. AND DAY BY DAY ALL GETTING UPDATED. THIS 1+5T WAS MY FIRST HIGH VALUE MOBILE AND THE EXPERIENCE WAS SMOOTH.I AM USING THIS MOBILE FOR 5 DAYS,BASED ON THAT I AM GIVING YOU THE RATING.CAMERA- 5/5DISPLAY- 5/5CALLING CLARITY - 5/5GPS - 5/5GAMES - 5/5 ( IN THIS EARTH ANY ANDROID GAMES SUPPORTED TILL NOW)LOUD SPEAKERS - 4/5  (AS ONLY ONE SIDE SPEAKER WAS BUILT)DASH CHARGING - 5/5INTERNET SURFING - 5/5BATTERY - 4/5LOOKS AND WEIGHT - STYLISH AND LIGHT.LASTLY DELIVER -  AWESOME WITH IN 56 HRS I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT."
A Great Phone Worth Your Money,"I bought this phone after checking many reviews. I compromised on few things due the price it carried. Below are the pros and cons after 1 month of usage.Pros : The phone is superfast. Without any lag ever. This was seen in all areas. Even connecting to wifi and somehow 4G speed is better. I have unistalled many apps and never seen uninstallation screen. Face unlock is magic. With the screen light option it even works in extreme dark conditions. It cannot be tricked and is amazingly fast. The battery and charging are also very good. I normally start charging from 20% and stop around 80%. This charge happens in no time. And battery is equally good. I love dark themes and amoled screen helps it. I keep waiting to charge the phone as my last phone had battery problems. I use saavn in office and watch atleast an hour of videos when not in office.The battery survived my work day even when it was at 66% in morning. The screen is great , my previous phone had IPS display. Also, this may be a compromise for people who have used phones with UHD screen. There are many settings to personalise the phone. A great point and shoot camera with portrait mode.Cons : Box did not include headphones. One speaker. My previous phone had beats audio with two speakers. So this was a let down. Night mode, zoomed photos are not so amazing. This was known to me. Panaromic view is a disappointment with multiple vertical lines introduced in the photo. The biggest con is Oneplus itself. I think they are not working on security. There have been two instances of breach from the time I purchased this phone. One with the credit card and other with data getting send to China. And Oneplus has not taken these two seriously. If they want to survive in the flagship phones market, they have to do more than what they did.This my first Oneplus phone, the phone is good. But i will wait and see where company wants to take itself. For person buying a flagship phone security is everything."
"Superb! Top value for money android with 90% of the features which ivy-league devices have to offer, at half the price.","Excellent phone. Im very happy with it. Best bang for your bucks. The in-hand feel is spectacular. Devices felt very well balanced & the weight distribution is almost spot on - this is something which Apple has executed well in the past. Glad to see OnePlus paying attention to these details. The screen is bright, clear & unless you pixel-peep with a magnifying glass, you wont notice any pixelation. Battery life is also acceptable, lasts for a day & topping it up with the dash-charger is easy-peasy.Photo quality is mostly great under normal conditions and unacceptable in darker situations. But thats okay with me. I didnt pay a small fortune like I would have for getting an ivy-league iphone or a Pixel. Overall, great phone & I dont see myself upgrading or changing anytime soon. This phone offers all the phone I would need for the time being."
Otherwise its a amazing phone. Keep up opo,Mine was a case of upgrade from one plus 1 to this phone. It was a heartily decision which I feel was correct. Only issue is a minor lag which is there while unlocking. Otherwise its a amazing phone. Keep up opo !
This is the best product out there at this price point,This is the best product out there at this price point.Camera selfie and main are very very good. Zooming makes images and video grainy. But its unfair to compare this phone with Apple samsung  etc.Audio loud speakers are loud but i rarely use them to listen to songs.UI is quick thanks to snapdragon processor and 6 gb ram.Video playback is clear. No lags. youtube does not utilize the full width of screen. Perhaps app update from youtube is awaited.Yet to check out phone performance with heavy graphics games.Dual sim works flawlessly. No issues with basic phone functionality bluetooth wifi.But only flip side of this slim good looking phone is vibration effect which is less.Face id and fingerprint security is extremely fast
Superb,An exclusive edition of the one plus 5T. No difference in terms of specs with the original 5T. A phone for the star wars fans. The white with the red star wars branding is brilliant and so is the kylo ren themed cover which is quite sturdy even though it wont lay flat on a surface. It comes pre loaded with star wars theme as well as wallpapers both of which will probably come to play store from third party ppl soon.A good buy since it costs only 1k more than the original 128GB  5T. Go for it if u r a true star wars fan or prefer a phone which does not look the generic black as most phones do nowadays.
Good phone,There is a lot of scope for  the improvement of daylight photos and portrait mode.However the overall performance of phone is exceptionally goodRating-Camera 7/10Battery life 9/10Processing speed 10/10Display 7/10Software 8/10Dash charging 10/10Audio quality 9/10Value for money 8/10
Move away Samsung n Apple..here comes one plus.. best phone in market,Completely satisfied.. an ardent Samsung user with great regret I compromised myself to buy dis phone instead of the Samsung s8+.. but after a weeks usage im glad I saved that xtra 20k bucks.. move away Samsung n Apple.. Here is oneplus .. a flagship in the making.. people considering of the Samsung s8 stuff pls think twice dis phone s worth ur valuable money xcept a few misses here n there u ll love dis phone..
Great value for money,The phone is awesome. Its very fast and no heating issues. Face recognition works really well and battery lasts for more than a day for my usage.
Three Stars,this phone had created more expectations while reading specs but not in real working conditions
The best you can buy at such a price.,"Awesome smartphone at a good price....My review after using the phone for 20 daysProsAwesome camera ,specially lowlightBattery life is very good....i am a heavy user and still the phone manages to pass a day with ease and survives till the next morning.......No lags no hangs 8 gb ram is what makes the phone works smoothly even tough if u have a ton of apps open.Touch is very responsive.Charging is very very fastCons-Speakers on the bottom....sometimes they get blocked by the hand or surface while using the phone.Back built quality is not up to the mark......altough ive been very cautious and careful,even have the back cover on the phone from day 1 still it has got minor scratches and its anntenna rubber thingh also has got a lot of scratches at the back even after heavy protection.Conclusion-This is a perfect smartphone for such a price.It has top notch features and does not fails to  amaze you with its performance and features.You womt feel like keeping the phone away its soo amazing.If the above cons are not a big issue for you guys then go for this phone.At first i was going in for google pixel 2 xl then i thought to give this beast a try and i dont regret my descision at all."
Beast in performance...... Lovin it ONE PLUS 5T rocks,"Excellent product and a beast in performance....Upgraded from my Old Sony Xperia Z3+ dual  (3GB RAM) to this One plus 5T (8GB RAM), its just superfast and DASH charger OMG its a beast in charging the phone in 60 min which will last u a full day.128 GB internal no SD card required. Face recognition in also amazing and of course camera is a top notch in this price segment.AMOLED display is a treat when u have a 18:9 display....Sleek look make it a Sexy machine to use.No lag, no lapse = Best performance via Snapdragon 835 processor.and to end we have face recognition and fingerprint scanner which is fastest in flagship."
No doubt the best phone,"No doubt this the best phone anyone could buy in 2017 although it does my have a pure android like the Google phones or the Motorola phones the stock android has its own advantages. There are many gestures which are awesome and the finger print scanner is amazing it unlocks at lighting speed . If you are an android lover and stop looking here and there just go for it . Also the camera is good with he new oxygen update has enhanced the optical stabilisation by which I can take steady video even while moving . One of the best things is if u want any software enhancement u keep it in the o eplus forums inbuilt app and if they like your recommendation they would add that feature in the upcoming update .Overall this is ""THE BEST PHONE EVER"""
Practical and modern phone,"Lets start with cons.1. Software has few bugs that can annoy on day to day basis.. like auto-rotation, brightness is too low on auto mode, despite I own 8gb varient, buttons response like text or calls is slower than my friends iPhone, and Bluetooth sometimes suddenly disconnects from my audio device which didnt happen on my previous phones. (am sure all these can be fixed)2. Charge on the phone stays for almost a day.. am a student and as I am a heavy user.. most others may not feel so but with OnePlus we would expect it to last longer.3. Camera- portrait mode is a crap at most situation as far as I have used.. and Shutter lag comparing with flagships.. s8 and iPhone 10 were really fast at shutter..4. Some of might face trouble with the charger as the brick is huge.. check pictures for references.THESE ARE THE FEWEST OF THE NEGATIVES TO SPOT ON THE PHONE.. AND NONE OF THESE WOULD PROBABLY BOTHER OTHER... And most of these can be fixef with an upgrade.On to the PROS,1. Design is very practical. Wil easily last for longer time than an iPhone 10 , s8 and other flagships + its sleak, beselless and modern!2. Camera does wonders from slowmo to lapse and every other feature on the camera is brilliant including low light photos... Sharp and clear.. a normal photo is very clear and perfect unlike the s8 which enhances contrast levels to keep the details..3. User friendly.. reason for me to buy this over a v30,.. many customisations possible, you wouldnt believe how user friendly this phone really is. It can do more than any other in the market and does not have unnecessary stuffs that could annoy us easily.. oxygen os on Android is the best for user interface.4. Dash charging . 1 and half hour from 0 to 100.. before this all my phone had charger next to bed and I slept and used the phone with charger..but with OnePlus 5t I havent had to worry about charging.. go for shower and by the time you are back it has more than half juice already!!!5.face unclocks even before you realise.. and same with finger print.. both make my life so much easier. As mentioned.. phone is 100% user friendly"
Best Android Phone its Price Segment,"Awesome phone, value for money. Stock Android experience. Oxygen OS brings in some good added features which does not come in the stock Android and are very useful in day today usage. Quick charge technology they use is unbeatable in all segments. There is only two thing to regret and that is, it comes only in one or two colour option. Special edition with different colour will launch after 3 months which is the disappointing factor for people who already bought the phone. Second point is every 6 months they launch a new model and obsolete the existing model. Android updates are very slow and it is not like the way they promised during their launch event"
Brilliant phone!,"Brilliant, moving from an iPhone 6s plus to the one plus 5t , moving to Android after quite abit and Im not disappointed one bit .A phone that gives the iPhone X stiff competition and costs less than half price makes so much more sense , especially in this day and age were technology gets redundant in no time and one feels the urge to change their phone every two years. This product is affordable luxury.Ive used it for more than 2 weeks now and I have no complaints .Brillaint cameraSurprisingly loud speaker for music and callsExcellent display may be not as good as the iPhone but Im not complaining after saving 60kBeautiful cameraDash charge is so so usefulHeadphone jack is a plusOreo update availableThe damage policy is reassuring some one whos cracked an expensive phone can relate, I have had friends whove gotten their damged one plus devices replaced at their door step with 24hoursIm totally sold. And really satisfied with my purchase"
Excellent phone,Excellent phone.. Amazing battery life. Superb built quality. Basic accessories like back cover and tempered glass already provided..is a big plus point. The OS is extremely fluid.. Camera is to be fallen in love with..Just that face unlock doesnt work in dark. Needs improvement.. Otherwise is extremely quick in 99% of the cases..OnePlus should come out with no cost emi option for 9 or 12 months also apart from the current 3 months.. This would enable everyone to get access to it.
Super se Uper,"Its simply best phone in this budget, face unlock is super se uper, you hardly need to use fingerprint scanner. Overall experience is too fluid, camera is best. Depth effect feels artificial sometime, else works great. Charging is supery fast, it took harcly hour to full charge it. Case bundled is cool and good gesture by One Plus.One star less coz no oreo update, nor promised exact date when it will come."
Good option I made to switch from an iPhone.,"This phone is really a good choice that stands out in performance with the given price point. Moreover I have been an iPhone user for last 8 years and this phone did not give me any hard time in deciding to switch to Android. Also the performance is very good to meet iphones standard of performance or looks. My Android auto works well, my Google chrome cast integrates well, and there are really few more advantages that I am enjoying day to day. Battery level is really really great. I would always carry my charging cable when I had iPhone 6s and now this stands easily for more than a day with even extensive usage. And charging time is from 10-100% happens in 1hr or 1hr 10mins. In overall I love this phone"
Five Stars,
Awesome phone. I love this phone but the delivery ...,"Awesome phone.I love this phone but the delivery is irritating.Pros:Good rear cameraAwesome displaySuper performance and speedOne of the fastest face detection, fingerprintSuper fast chargingCons:Worst delivery... received the package which is damaged. chances that phone may also get damaged. Impolite serviceFront camera is ok but not great"
Fabulous phone no issue,"This phone is so brilliant that it did not have single cons. I had replace this with my iphone and after that I am very happy. Much much better and advance than iphone. Superb camera, speed, muti tasking, Android edge, screen, light weight and many more. A perfect value for money phone."
Beauty and Beast,Bought 8/128 on prime sale. Unboxing and feeling the phone is awesome. Premium look and finesse.Performance.!!.it simply wows you every time you open the device.Facelock has some issues in my phone..maybe updates will fix...but I prefer fingerlock.. superfast.Camera .. great pics in low light..and awesome Colors.Dashcharge... nothing can beat this..Above all value for your money. (Same features iPhone cost you one lac).A powerful beautiful premium beast in your hand.No second thought to buy the upcoming any OnePlus device.
Excellent phone for 33k,"So the phone is awesome. There are other reviews with technical details, so will skip that bit.I bought the 6/64gb option. It works great and dont feel the need for the more expensive 8/128.The look and feel of the phone is good, feels premium and has full screen available which is great. For the same size as 1plus3 I get more screen.Fingerprint scanner is at the back, takes a little time to get used to.The OS is slick and light weight and is a breeze to operate.Camera is much improved although the selfie could have been better. Its not the best camera but much better than previous versions.Charger has become very bulky and is huge.Other than that, the phone is superb and probably the best value for money at this price.I am still trying to figure how to open the kotak account to get the 1yr insurance free."
Go for it.. excellent product.,"This is my first OP product. In simple words Impressed. Face ID was initially detecting with even closed eyes , but the issue got resolved on software updation..Pros are many .. lightning fast,excellent display,no heating at all,good call clarity,finger print scanner is at perfect place,speaker clarity and volume the best I have experienced.camera is performing the job well.. face ID works even at low lights..Battery lasts for a day average.."
Awsome phone!!!!!???,"MY REVIEW AFTER USING THE PHONE FOR MORE THAN 3 WEEKS.Very happy with the purchase till now everything works fine as promised.The best part about the phone is the dash charging... I never really mind charging every now and then because the battery lasts for the whole day on normal usage and even if charge gets over it only takes half an hour to charge it back up to a decent percentage so i dont worry about charging a lot.Camera also works great. Not the very best but definitely works alright for me. Portrait mode works very well. But i do notice a lot of noice in low light condition. I dont know if its a normal thing in phones but i did notice that so just saying it as it is.And the performance is... how do i put it ""extremely good"". Apps load faster than the speed of light?. Software experience is also awsome. I used to use nova launcher prime on my previous device and had planned to use the same on my op5t but oxygenOS was good enough for me so i sticked to that instead.I do notice a few software glitches here and there though for e.g. swiping down from the top of the screen for notification bar is a hit or miss most of the time. Swiping down does not always gets me to the notification bar . So i do struggle with it at times. Also while typing on gboard sometimes i accidentally tap on multitasking button so it breaks my consistency during typing. This never happened before in my previous phone, maybe its my bad ,but thats that.But these problems would probably get fixed in the future updates and it doesnt bug me that much anyways so its not a big deal .Overall I would like to say that this is definitely an awsome phone for the price range. But if water resistance and 4k screens are a priority for you then i would suggest to spend some more cash for better phones. LG v30+ is a good bet i think and apparently pixel 2 phones are also available at 49k now.So if you think you could spend that much, then go for these phones instead but for 33k i can surely say that one plus5t wont disappoint you. ?"
"A clean and Powerful phone, which wont let you down","After using multiple Redmi Phones, I decided to get flagship experience. I really liked the performance and in extreme conditions the phone showed its awesomeness.Even it has a lot of positive reviews all over the YouTube but I will try to give you some cons which I thought that you should know before buying this phone.The first thing is the camera which should have a Lil better. The camera has very real dynamic colours as well as it performs really well in auto HDR but in low light conditions, the details are lost.Oneplus has improved camera performance after recent update and they are continuing the effort to make it more like a true flagship performer.Using it in reading mode gives me pleasure because the amoled screen looks brilliant in black and white and it gives less stress on eyes also.Overall I would give a thumbs up to this phone and the present referral program program add Icing into the cake you could add use my coupons to get extended warranty I am enclosing it as a snapshot.On successful referral of both the codes you can earn up to 6 months Extended Warranty.Post the offer period, both the referrer and referee will receive a confirmation e-mail confirming the activation of the extended warranty as applicable by March 31, 2018.Coupon code for use on purchase of OnePlus 5T (Midnight Black 6GB RAM + 64GB memory): 65SD-B6LG4H-ZQHAU2Coupon code for use on purchase of OnePlus 5T (Midnight Black 8GB RAM + 128GB memory): FZ8Z-ARLN79-A3VG8R"
The Best phone in this price range..!!,"You might think 33K is a huge money,yes it is a huge amount for some but its totally worth it.We get a superb phone with a?Very decent display,the colors are vivid with its sAMOLED display?It has the snapdragon 835 inside.Its so fluid with the oxygen OS inside?The speaker is very loud?The charging speed is extremely fast.dash charging charges my phone in just 1 hour.?The highlight its camera.it dosent have the standard of iphone X, google pixel 2 or galaxy note 8 but for its price range it is awesome?On paper its just 3300 mah but it lasts me for a day easily?It looks superb in its 18:9 ratio display?Fingerprint sensor is lightning quick?Face recognition is scary fast.you have to use it to understand what I am saying aboutWe compare this phone with google pixel 2 and iphone X.The phones mentioned have double the price by paying double the price we just get a better display and a better camera thats it,so i recommend all to take this phone"

This phone is one of the best available in the Indian Market,"This phone is one of the best available in the Indian Market. I exchanged my MotoG4 plus for this and got additional ?5,700/- off. And ?1500/- off the using my HDFC card. So cutting the long story short, I purchased this phone around ten days back at 25,800/- only. You get a protective scratch guard and a silicon back case with it. I have already ordered a sturdy case and a tempered glass for this, since the scratch guard will only protect it from scratches. No headphones provided. Dash Charger is a beast and fully charges your phone in an hour. Battery lasts me an entire day. The phone does not heat up while charging. Photo quality is excellent. Being a blogger, I always need good quality photographs for my blog. Loving the time lapse option for videos. However, the zoom quality is not upto the mark. Display is mind blowing. Face recognition technology is superb! I would say, for people having ?30,000/- as your budget, go for it. 64GB RAM and processor speed makes the experience smooth."
"Its been a month, Very good phone","Its been a month, I migrated from Redmi, One plus is really Amazing the only problem i do see is the camera lens is kept bulky so the lens may get scratches when you keep it on a table or a rough surfaceSuper fast face unlock, superfast fingerprint sensor, super camera effectsVery good phone, I am having 64 GBversion"
Camera not impressive for this cost,"`I got this phone in a box with  damaged corners but amazon delivery agent justifies that all boxes came in same wayLove this phone for its 6inches awesome display but  the camera is not much impressive ëven after the latest build, portrait mode is lagging for 2 secs after every clickCons:Default SMS app is not working to send messages if the contact number has country code associatedSelfie mode portrait is not available (I am not aware of this before ordering so want to let people know)Camera is poor in low light and only portrait photos looks impressivePortrait mode is lagging, you have to wait for 2 secs after every click , this happens in 5T only"
Five Stars,Awesome cameraAwesome speed
its just the greed for a latest beauty like 5t. Do not have a second thought,This is my 3rd one plus phone after 2 & 3.. i wasnt attracted to 5.. but 5t made me go for it.. even though the need of a new phone did not rise in me considering the one plus 3 i own(absolutely flawless).. its just the greed for a latest beauty like 5t.Do not have a second thought.. this phone is worth buying and has a life time using capability.. unless u get tempted for a new one..
Loved the phone being a techie and an IPhone fan,"Loved the phone being a techie and an IPhone fan, the reason why I considered one plus is because of the idea what they are about that is listening to the audience which others dont offer being closest to the stock android gives the stability with no lags which makes it a perfect companion for the daily use.>> Value for Money>> Best android phone in the market 2017>> star war edition worth spending 1000rs if you want that granite finish but if you prefer metal case than no it is not..>> Looks way better than the standard 5t>>Suggest to always go for 128GB edition though you do not need that space because more is always good"
Superb display Slim design Very good sound quality Superb camera Bokeh effect is really effective ...,Pros:Superb displaySlim designVery good sound qualitySuperb cameraBokeh effect is really effectiveSelfie is goodLow light photography is goodBattery is very good and charges very fastNever lagsVery smooth touchNice UICons:Only issue is with zooming of clicked photos. They blur out slightly.Final verdict :This is next to Apple iPhone X.
Superb Value for Money,"Using for almost a week now, love the phone and apart from minor issues, it is amazing value for money.Pros:1. Great battery life (easily lasts over a day with moderate use)2. Superb display3. Really good camera both front and back (I am not a camera expert, so cant give detailed feedback :))4. Finger print scanner and face unlock work great and really fast.5. Phone doesnt heat up even during charging and charges from 20 to 90 in about an hour.Cons:1. Seems to download whatsapp and other notifications even when data and wi-fi are off (seems to be a bug, which hopefully will be fixed soon)2. For people moving from a smaller size phone, the large screen might take time to get used to.3. Whatsapp LED notification doesnt work when we remove the sound & vibrate, and just keep LED light customization, had to reset whatsapp notification settings to make it work.4. LED notification light is not as strong as other phones and might take time to notice it.5. App notification counter is missing, hopefully they will add it in the next update.If your budget is around 30k, blindly go for it. If you can spare the extra 15-20k, then you can checkout the pixel 2. I saw the iphone X and it wasnt much better compared to the 5t, so total value for money when you compare how much the iphone X costs."
one plus 5T is the best return for money,"I was an iPhone user and those who are would know how difficult it is to switch to different brand.But comparing the specs and prices, one plus 5T is the best return for money.I went for the latest Lava Red one and it turned out great.Things I loved bezel less 6 inch  screen, I thought it would be bulky coming from smaller size phone, but bezel less does the trick.And if you are iPhone user and worried how would you transfer data, there is simple option to backup your data like pics, contacts on Google drive and can get it on your new one plus 5T easily.Things I liked :1. The face unlock works wonderfully which I was not expecting would work so well.2. Slimness of the phone3. Oxy os on top of Android4. There lot many features which you will adoreSo if are doubtful like me and been reviewing many phones to purchase from this is right choice, go for it."
Good clean Android OS,"The Force is strong with this One+.Good clean Android OS, decent hardware. Vivid display, back texture feels amazing, color accents and the Star Wars logo look great. The LE silicon case is nice and protects the phone but its too bulky, using it with the official sandstone case.Everything else is as expected, above average to awesome. Not really happy with the camera though, color reproduction is sometimes poor and depth effects is a hit or miss, with the images looking cropped using Photoshop or something. Low light shots are a bit of a let down too unfortunately.Having said all that, I love this device. Overall performance is A+ for 1+ 5t."
One plus Nailed it..,"I am very happy to actually buy this one finally. This phone is so worth spending money on. Believe me in this budget , no one else is providing this wide array of features along with build quality, brand value and most importantly trust. It has got superb screen, blazing fast face and fingerprint unlock, great camera, and  looks,  dash charge, latest android,  best customer care in India, and number of other cool things like free insurance, zomato gold membership etc..  that you realize only when you start using it. Its not the purpose of buying it, but you will get lots of attention due to it, many people have come to me asking ""which phone is this?"", ""Is the new iphone?"".The only sad thing for me is the news that they are coming up with oneplus 6 this march which i expect to be cooler than this one. So if you wanna believe the rumours then wait till March . Otherwise, this is best bet you have today.. Just go and buy this one."
Just blink and its done. Best hardware money can buy.,"Using for a week now and trust me its blistering fast, all other phones feel slow after using this.Camera:9/10Battery:9/10Dash charging: 10/10. Just 40 min to full charge and lasts for a day.Hardware : 8/10. Camera bump irritatesCase included : 6/10. Op could have included sandstone caseTyping on keyboard : 8/10Software: 8/10In hand feel: 10/10Low light and portrait mode: 8/10Talking about software, I fell there are some glitches but it can be fixed with future updates and OP has good track record of pushing new software updates.Best software Tweeks:1. Drag down anywhere on screen for notification tray2. Drag up anywhere on screen for piling up app grid3. Profile change switch to put in silent, general mode4. Camera and low light pictures.Got it damn cheap during sale after exchange and cashback. Thanks Amazon.My Verdict: Checkout for sale and cashback, try to get it below 28K."
T-for Terrific or Terrible? Review After 2 Months of Usage,"First of all Kudos to Amazon for the inside-2 days delivery. Flipkart are you listening?Now, since I am already reviewing this one quite late, lets jump to the hits and misses of the new ""Flagship Killer""Pluses -1. The Oxygen UI definitely. One Plus has bundled so many essential features with this UI, that its hard to ignore. Starting from the indispensable Reader Mode, Screen Calibration, Noise Cancellation during calls and many more2. Camera - Camera has been the USP of all One Plus devices. This ones no different. Cameras are good in daylight. Much hyped portrait mode works best on human subjects, looks artificial on the rest. Night photos are decent but noise is visible.3. There is absolutely no lag in the day to day tasks. 6 GB of RAM is more than enough in most cases. Games, Youtube, Browsing everything is smooth.4. Battery backup is good. 5-5.5 hrs of SOT is what can be expected on an average. My best SOT result was 6.1 hrs. Dash cahrging is a boon to say the least. Doesnt heat up the phone. Charges from 4-100 in 1h20 mins. Amazing5. NFC is really helpful. Gestures are another great feature. Three finger swipe, O to open the camera app etc are my favourite.6. Despite teh 18:9 display, a lot of apps do not support the feature. Barrring Hotstar, Voot, and other streaming apps I found this feature missing in most of the other apps.Minuses -1. Now there are many. To start off No Oreo out-of-the-box. Oreo was available by the time this product launched and I would have appreciated if it was included. It doesnt make a big difference since I love Nougat.2. I havent updated my phone. The reviews of the new OXygen Os 5.0.2 which is Oreo Build are disastrous. There are reports of Phone hanging, Battery discharge even on Standby, Camera irresponsiveness, among others.3. One of the biggest drawbacks and I was shocked when I found this out, was that there was no FM Radio. A basic feature, present even on 600 bucks features phone. But a 30K-plus phone omitted it. I hope such blunders from the ""Flagship Killer"" do not end up killing the company itself.4. Face Unlock is a hit and a miss. Works well in clear lighting. Doesnt work that well in artificial lighting and doesnt work at all in dimly lit conditions.5. The official cases cost a bomb. I like a fool ended up buying the Karbon fiber Bumper Case because there arent many good cases available in other platforms, and almost none available locally. Online paid reviews say the case provides excellent grip and blah-blah. Thats bullshit not only its slippery but is also a fingerprint and dust magnet. I am now back to using the Transparent TPU case.In conclusion, the OP 5T was a sure-shot recipe for success, bogged down by One Pluss own absurd cost-cutting techniques. I am deducting a point for the flaws I just stated. Otherwise, the best thing you can get for 33 K.Cheers!!!!!"
Good gadget in this price,"Excellent display, super loud sound speaker ( though not stereotype.. ) RAM management superb..! With good processor.. built quality and design. Front camera good with dual camera set up @ rare, portrait mode excellent..No radio.. little bit fuzzy sound with in/out phone call quality.."
Best phone ever.,"Before I bought this phone I spend a week researching it and checking all sorts of written and hands on reviews. Im happy to say that it has lived up to them.PROSExcellent battery life, screen real estate, super snappy and very customizable. Decent camera. Fast fingerprint and face unlock features.Note: It has a better battery life than any premium flagship on the market and chsrges faster than them too.Id advise that you pick up the 8gb model with 128 gb ram. More futureproof.ConsNone. If youre buying this phone its understood you arent looking for premium flagship features like ip68 protection or stunning camera quality. That being said, it does pretty well in both departments.Amazon delivered it in less than 20 hours. Amazing service as always."
Briefing about Pros and Cons,"It is indeed the best phone in this price bracket or what you call as a ""Flagship killer"".Ive been using this since a month and would brief the pros and cons :Pros :1. Better display, youll notice when you compare a normal image with anyone elses phone. Everything looks really good.2. Amazing camera. Im sure youll the camera. Dont depend upon portrait mode on low light though.3. Good speakers, the speakers are loud and smooth.4. FACE ID and Touch ID/Fingerprint is astonishingly fast AF.5. Great bandwith, I got better network signals in my place.6. Extremely FAST AF CHARGING.7. Comes with a headphone jack.Cons :1. Since the phone is a bit big, it might not be much handy for you.2. The midnight black material is way too slippery and catches fingerprints so better put on a cover.3. Battery is average .4. Oreo update hasnt come just yet.Hope I was able to clarify all the pros and cons I noticed."
Outstanding and Great Value !!,"Its an outstanding phone, best ever One plus device.Pros:Outstanding job with Battery, it last so well.Screen qualityRAM 8GB habdles anything you throw at it. Zero lag!!Storage is ample with 128 GB.Dashcharge outstanding.Oxygen OS is turned to best now.Face unlock and finger print unlock is amazing.very premium looks.ConsNoneMay be OIS however excellant EIS covers it up.Very Satisfied, suggest 128GB variant as you are future ready for at least three years."
Beast within a Beauty.,"Absolute best in this price range. i bet u wont find anything like this in market.build quality is awesome, hardware is of a beast and looks are of a beauty. NO lags whatsoever. camera quality is also very nice.Support and updates from ONEPLUS are very good.Must buy for those who love big screen with performance of snapdragon 835 & 8 gb ram."
OnePlus 5T rocks,"I was a apple lover.  And used almost every model of iPhone.  But this time I shifted to OnePlus 5T.Wow! What a phone.  Its seriously a beautiful work by the engineers.  Everything is just up to the mark.  The camera is awesome the phone battery last for more than a day. No more lacking of the device, its smooth, super awesome screen.  Just if it would have a stereo speakers and the earphones then it would be 100 out of 100 for me.  Now it just 99..I hope I would get a good service from the OnePlus team.Thanks"
Premium Handset,"Buy if you are looking an all-round Android phone..Supports heavy gaming, photography(take superb low light pictures) and apps( RAM management is awesome).Display is just wow. SUPER sensitive and produce sharp images. The 18:9 screen ratio is just perfect for watching movies!!Has reading mode to read books(helpful those who use Kindle app) without putting any stress on the eyes. Battery life is commendable..last a day on heavy usage.One of the issues- protruding rear camera lenses : please be careful while placing the phone on hard surfaces. Also the phone design is slick- use a good back cover!!!No earphones in the accessories Not water resistant and scratch proof.  Although, it comes with Gorilla Glass 5, few accidental low - level drops wont do any damage to the screen.Using this beast for a month and found no other issues than I mentioned here. Just enjoy the ultimate experience.Peace out!!"
Best Upgrade ever!!!,"Best Smart Phone ever:1) Best Processor.2) Camera is Excellent (especially portrait mode), however low light feature needs to improve because photos still has noises.3) Battery lasts for a day considering that I use Jio 4G, through the day.4) Delivery was apt.5) Light weight as well.6) Charging is so fast, i have not seen a faster charger.7) Overall the best I can have considering I moved from Moto X Play"
finger print unlock and the face unlock which is super super quick,"Reviewing after using for 15 days,Lets begin with the unlock, one gets three options for unlocking the phone, the regular pin code, finger print unlock and the face unlock which is super super quick, its faster then the S8 and iPhone X, though I phone X unlock is better in dark, 5T doesnt open when its dark,Ram- I am using the 6 GB version, which I think is more then enough, it doesnt lags at all, you can check the speed test comparison with other phones in YouTube.Camera- the portrait mode, pro mode is amazing, the only Android phone camera better then 5T is the pixel 2.Overall its the best Android phone absolute on market at this price."
Really! its a Flagship KILLER...,One of the Best Phones i have ever used. The Software is too Fluid and the RAM management is top notch. One of the best buys under 35k.Even if u open 10 tabs Simultaneously all the tabs will be in memory even if u open them after 20 mins.Thank you Oneplus for the great device.
Photos captures in low light are not at all good.,"Placement of Volume rocker on the left side and power button on the right is very inconvenient. Every time I press power button, volume rocker also gets pressed causing volume settings to change unintentionally.Photo captures in low light are not at all good."
Awesome phone in every sense,"Loved this phone. I  dont need to review this because, already so many people have said so much good about this phone. Everything is good camera, battery backup, charging time, screen, looks etc. If you have that much money in your pocket, this is the phone you must choose,"
Simply Superb,"Beauty and the Beast = OnePlus 5T. Already owned an Oneplus 3 for couple of years before I decided to give Oneplus one more change with the 5T. As guessed no regrets. Every thing is easy with this mobile. Considering I got the 8 GB version, it should keep the lags/mis-touches at bay for atleast another couple of years.Please Oneplus dont provide with Buggy updates to make this awesome phone weak over the period of time. We die-hards get oneplus because it is not just value for money but it is peace of mind. Keep up the good work Amazon and OnePlus."
One plus one 5t ...a complete package,"Excellent phone for the price. Most practical and functional. Amazing operating interface. The feel and look is premium, relatively lighter and ergonomically designed. The added feature of face detection is unbelievably fast and beats the premium phones of same feature in the market. Now talking about the picture quality... i really went on to compare few shots taken on this phone with the dslr and was simply spellbound by the quality of pics taken by this phone. The bokeh(portrait) mode pics steals the show. The low light pics taken are astounding. Complete package and value for money. All my 5 stars for this one. One plus manufacturers take a Bow. Add me as a fan in ur club."
"Think before your buy, the sellers are lied!","I have been using this phone for a bit now here is what I have to as a visual content creator.- love the hardware- love a color, pair it with a spegen cover it looks ravishing- Hate the support on insta- upload an image on Instagram the resolution sucks- lot of there bugs that make the phone slow after the Oreo update- low light camera is a myth, the images sucksVerdict: If your buying this phone thinking your saving money, huh no your are not,add few thousand rupees buy a pixel2. Over all if camera is the selling factory plz I am telling you its not a value for money"
Excellent phone for the money,"Phone is excellent. Operations are smooth. Fast and quick to respond. Extremely fast fingerprint sensor ( like the OnePlus 3). Face unlock works very well , even in relatively low light. The bigger screen is a major plus. Display is good and very readable even in sunlight.But the camera could have been better. Thats the only thing not matching up the hype. Good photos under good lighting conditions, but grainy in low light.Too much software beautification. But with the latest patches camera is better."
iPhone to OnePlus,"Was an ardent fan of iPhone for years & was using an iPhone6 for the last 2 years.. so decision on OnePlus5t was a major change & I am glad that I decided to make that call..10 times faster than an iPhone & 100% satisfied with my decision..Everything is synced in full & no impact on my usage atall, infact happier!"
Never Settle for One Plus 5Ts Terribly Mediocre Camera.,"One Plus, a formidable market base in India, with its surprising One Plus 5T launch had hooked many of its customers to this variant.The One Plus 5T is no doubt the best in the market, but I have a few cons Id like to share which largely focuses on Camera and Storage Issues.For starters, when you open the camera and zoom into an object or space, with less light or not, the pictures become pixelated and grainy, which bugs users based on on paper promise by One Plus. And whats worse is that, they dont upgrade the software(which is the least they can do)or fix the issues somehow."
OnePlus have got a winner! - OnePlus 5T,"The way OnePlus have come up with 5T is just amazing! The camera which is the main attraction lives up to the hype! The dimensions of the phone are well defined which makes it very handy rather comfortable to use. Well it doesnt have any extra inbuilt features like samsung because you pay for camera, display which is crisp, hardware (8GB RAM/128GB ROM) & durability! Well battery backup also is unexpectedly remarkable and hence i can say that OnePlus has a winner in their hands! Pay half the price of apples, samsungs and other brands flagship model! I promise you, you will be satisfied!"
One of the Awesome Phone(1+5T),"OnePlus 5T is one of the best smartphones ever Oneplus consists a kind of attitude in young youth.Oneplus 5T every features mindblowing and I am completely a fan of this phone.superb key features of this phone are1.super camera2.fantastic design3.dash charging4.no heat while playing games(one of the best smartphone for gaming lovers)5.edge to edge displayand so many another cool feature consists of OnePlus 5T.One hidden feature of Oneplus is please try (1+=) in your calculator and see magic(#NEVER_SETTLE).And I would like to thanks, Amazon to deliver this product within 20 hours.""NEVER SETTLE"""
"Its not a phone, its a beast.","If you are confused with which variant to choose then let me you, look for how much storage you need. 6/8 GB Ram is more than enough in your day to day use. There are other flagship phones like Google pixel or Samsung Galaxy S8 edge have 4 GB Ram and they are run smoothly without any lag.OnePlus has evolved in last few years and has earned the trust of users. I am using this phone (128 GB) for past 2 weeks and it is whooping fast, thanks to the mighty Snapdragon 835 processorand Andreno 540 GPU.If you are looking for pros and cons then check out detailed reviews on dedicated youtube channels."
it is awesome. Great speed,"Moved from an iPhone to this after 3 years of usage. Except notifications (which is applicable for Android), specially badges, it is awesome. Great speed, good picture quality and good value for money. Maybe a little more focus on the speakers would be great."
Killer always by one plus one..,Superb by one plus ..this is my second phone which is also from one plus ....Camera (both) are fantasticBattery is full of dayHardware and processor is awesomeN one can beat this in this price range..hands on op5t
nice!,"a truely flagship killer. i am an iphone 6s user wanted to switch to android because the iOS nowadays full of bugs and thrashes. Since I decided to switch, I wanted to but Google Pixel 2 XL at first, but its screen is such a messed with full of controversy. So Im here, saving about half of my budget with the same processor specs. Goodjob for the seller, Oneplus, and amazon delivery agent."
"Great Camera, Great Phone!!","A great Phone, Screen is too vibrant and bright and the 2:1 Aspect Ratio maintains everything on point and sharp too!!I am totally impressed by its camera too leaving a great Low Light Camera if switched to Pro Mode for Photography. Lags just a teeny meeny bit from Pixel 2 as it doesnt offer the Selfie Portrait Mode unlike the Pixel 2!An amazing phone, and damn fast too!! Everything gets on with just a snap of an eye!!!I have been using it since only one day and till now the first impressions are amazing!"
Quite satisfy with OnePlus 5T,"I am quite satisfy with OnePlus 5T because of its awesome looks, speedy performance, quick charging, battery backup, good camera (i m not camera freak though). its overall a good package. but there r some points which i dont like:  swiping down to recieve call, no option to delete call log by selection and issues while screen casting to my lloyd led tv. I hope these software related issues will be addressed in their next software update. Apart from these points, this is the best smartphone in this price range. And thanks to Amazon for delivering it in a good package 2 days before the commited date."
The phone is very awesome. Hardware and design is good however it is ...,"The phone is very awesome. Hardware and design is good however it is slippery. User interface is quite good but not as good as IOS. I have switched to Android from IOS, after using IOS four and half year. OS update or not released globally. You will find some works and interface issues during the initial release as always. Fibre one plus software team is very effective on solving issues of software through their community.Camera is good and 18 to 9 ratio is quite amazing. It needs improvement in the Portrait mode."
One Sentence.... IPhone X & Samsung 8 Plus killer.,"The best Cell Phone money can buy, Strongly built, sleek in design, Super fast UI, Amazing Battery life more than a day on singled charge & ultra fast Dash recharging... 8GB Ram & 128 GB Rom is blazing fast & enough... Thank u Oneplus & Amazon."
Go for it !!,"This phone is awesome. If you have the budget just go for it. I love the screen a lot. Am lot more into phone than earlier. Photos are great. I still havent been able to take good low light photos. Battery charges so fast. It took about 20 minutes to charge from 0 to 40%. Once you have charged full , it holds well for a days use.  ( I watched 6 hours of TV series, talked over call for 1 hour and kept my data ON - it lasted a day )You get a basic scratch guard and protective cover along with the phone.I have used the phone for more than 20 days now. I will update the comments once I use it for 6-7 months."
Satisfied. 5T fills the gap. Thumps up to OnePlus team.,Its really an amazing product. Everything is as smooth as butter. Be it the processor or the display. Camera is good but could have been better esp for low light photography. The feature of bokeh effect seems impressive and clicks awesome pictures during daylight.And the best part is the battery and the dash charger.Overall you will not be disappointed with this. Can go forward if looking at this price range. But make sure to also order tempered glass and a back case along with it.
Best phone in the best price.,"What to say.  Nothing beats 1 plus 5t unless u r damm i phone conscious personality.  Buying this phone is like buying woodland shoes which will never get tear apart,  your foot size may increase.  Its high technology is ok to last for another 2 years smoothly."
Bang for the buck!,"Total beast of a phone. Simply bang for the buck..dual sim..dash charge..I switched from an iPhone and Im loving it. Camera is great..Android is super smooth. Oh yes it has an auxjack too so that makes it all the more appealing to me atleast. Good job oneplus, cant wait to upgrade this to Oreo."
Amazing phone at this range.,"Guys I have received this phone 2 days back. I must tell everyone that I am iPhone user from last 3 years but after switching to One Plus 5t, I dont have any regret for that. Even I felt so much happy by using this amazing high speed android.This phone is having lots of amazing features at this range. Its processor is so much fast & os is also user friendly. Camera quality is not far better than iPhone but apart from it, everything is superb.I recommend everyone that if you have this much of budget then go for this phone only."
Excellent phone ?,As expected a brilliant budget limited edition device.Everything works perfectly and the best part about the phone is without doubt the dash charging. It absolutely is 100% true that you get a days charge in just under 30mins. Also you can always use your favourite headphones without the hassle of dongles.
Best Flagship Phone,True Flagship Phone from oneplusExcellent Display QualityUltimate fast fingerprint scanner and face unlockDash charge ultimate fastExcellent CameraDont think too much just purchase this Beast and enjoyReally enjoying using this phone from last 3 days
Super fast processor and high availability of RAM takes it ...,I have used One Plus 5T for over 3 weeks. Here are my viewsPros1. Super fast processor and high availability of RAM takes it super phone.2. Bloat free software. Oxygen OS works brilliantly.3. Best Cameephone andriod phone.4. Battery last a day.4. Charging via Dash charging is super quick. Charges 70% in 20 minutes.5. Display ratio works 18:9 looks stunning.Cons1. Would have preferred to Super AMOLED display instead of HD display.2. 5T should have been released with battery capacity of 4000 MH battery.3. ONE Plus should have got IP68 rated display.
Rank #1 phone of 2017!!!Go buy it!!!,"Awesome phone!!! You cant get better than this at this cost!!!phn works smoothly due to 8gb ram, 128 gb internal memory. Face recognition works better than I phone x, even in low light it works fine. Also phn detects my touch for unlocking the phn. Pics in portrait mode are crisp, super fantastic camera!!!! 18:9 & amoled display gives a good feel while watching vids!!!special thanks to gorilla glass, phn is not complete without this feature.In all this phn is recommended for all!!! I am loving it!!! Hope to get oreo update soon!!!"
I Love This Product,I Love This Product.I Brought it 15 days back and from the first day I started loving it.After using 15 days I am writing this review.Pros :1.Excellent Battery Back up easily comes for 1 day even if you surf the internet and take the photos continuously.2.Super fast charging by dash charging mechanism.3.Camera Quality is Amazing both Front and Real Dual Camera are simply awesome.4.Great finishing and looks beautiful in hand.5.Even though it is 6 Inch but its size as same as 5.5 inch mobile as display covers most of the section.6.Super fast Processing.7.Excellent feature of Face recognition and Finger print unlock is rocket speed.8. Sound is both external and Head phone are loader enough and Quality of output sound is also excellent.Cons :Till found nothing.If you are ready to put more than 30K and not a fan of Apple please go for it.
Absolutely beast !,This phone is absolutely a beast .1 - SD 835 + 8 GB ram is very very snappy2- Face unlock is magical3- camera performance is top notch4- Battery life is great5- Dash charge is quite fastThings I miss1- QHD Screen for better VR performance.
ONEPLUS 5T,Best Phone For Android Users..In hand fill is light and premium..Display is awesome and face unlocking is blazing fast..Super Smooth And Fast Fill Will Using It..BEST PHONE FOR ITS PRICE..(CAMERA ONEPLUS Says Low Light Cameras)BUT ONE THING I NOTICE THAT IN DAYLIGHT/LOWLIGHT BOTH CAMERAS ARE NOT WORKING AT A SAME TIME.. IN NORMAL SHOT (ONLY ONE) CAMERA WORKS ..WHEN I ZOOM THEN SECOND CAMERA COME IN WORK.. AND LOWLIGHT SHOTS ARE NOT THAT GOOD.. Still Giving 5Stars..?
Bought it for the awesome low light photography and the portrait mode,"Bought it for the awesome low light photography and the portrait mode!!Totally happy..These two are the only thing that you cant compare with the likes of motos honors and galaxies!!Functioning is smooth,6GB RAM shows its effect when you play games like ASPHALT 8 & NFS..Overall a good investment!!"
Good phone and a better battery life. Dash charger is a pure bliss.,If you are the owner you know it is the best phone on its price range.1. Big screen size.2. Battery backup and charging3. Camera4. Android experience5. Storage and Ram management6. Snapdragon performance7. Fingerprint unlock and camera unlock is fast.8. Storage is 64 GB and would store enough9. Display is goodThings I did not like1. Too loud speaker2. Camera stabilization3. Speaker placement is bad especially while playing  games4. At this price earpiece should be included in box.
Awesome phone and great service by amazon,"Awesome phone. Had issues with the first order. Amazon was prompt in replacing the mobile. New phone reached me within 3 days.Pros and cons have already been discussed by other customers, but I am totally happy with the product."
OnePlus Beast,"This phone is a bang for buck.. Iam a huge fan of OnePlus as my first product was OnePlus X (beauty).This upgrade is freaking awesome, blazing fast and smooth with this beautiful 6"" screen.A bit excited about Android Oreo update while going through those threads about it.The way I call it is a Beast!!A very big facepalm to those overpriced Smartphone manufacturers.Surely one of the best smartphones of 20th centuryOnePlus anticipating the customers for every upgrade."
Honest Review,"I got this phone about a month back and I am extremely pleased with quality of OP. The phone feels sturdy, well built and strong. However, I think the grip could have been better and I found myself to be worried when using the phone with one hand.Coming to the display, I switched from a LCD display so I was literally mesmerised by the crisp details of an AMOLED.The camera is also one of my favourite things in my 5T it takes extreme details even in low light. But, the potrait mode could have been a bit better.I hope this review helps someone seeking honest advice. Thanks."
"Dont think twice, just go for it. ?","Flawless work on the device. Its the best thing you can have in high end phones.It is super sleek, very comfortable to hold.Doesnt lag or make you wait. The software is rocking.Battery is top of the line. Easy 8 hour screen on time which is very very difficult in any other high end device.Games work beautifully without a hitch. Just loving it.Camera could have been better.. Everything bout Oneplus 5T is just ???"
Great phone it can do any task which we throw ...,Used almost all the phones till now but one plus has made its own branding a unique style with simplicity. Great phone it can do any task which we throw the only downside is the camera algorithms camera is good but after processing in certain cases are quite aggressive which finally results in some cartoonish effect. Rest wil gove 5 stars as software bugs can be resolved. Get the 6gb variant as there is not a big difference between the speed. If one needs extra space then go for the 8gb variant otherwise 6 gb is best.
I am happy with the purchase,"After using for 2 weeks, I am happy with the purchase. UI is very snappy, no lags at all, played multiple games, saw videos - I got good battery back of a day with heavy usage. Call used to drop couple of times and had to struggle to reconnect where my earlier Samsung phone used to work  flawlessly - I hope it is one off case or gets fixed in some updates in future.Only issue I am facing is to carry the bulky charger with me always - due to dash charger and type C cable. OEM OnePlus chargers are very costly."
iPhone Killer For Sure,"I love this phone. I am migrating from iPhone and I never thought I will start using Android again. However, due to the high costs and lack of good reviews of iphone x, I decided to check out Android again.This phone is awesome. It is super fast and is loaded with features. I am still exploring and loving it more and more."
Its a Bea5T,"The best of OnePlus had offered ?? previously I had the OnePlus 3 and that was amazing experience !The latest flagship OnePlus 5t offers the best features for the right budget .Worth for the money dude ?While other brands focus on the technology , user satisfaction and money but for OnePlus technology and the user satisfaction is first ???Camera , Display , speaker , oxygen os , battery and many other features  they are performing well ..I have no issues with it ..Thanks OnePlus ?? online review for OnePlus 5t ..Its a Bea5T?"
Value for money.. buy it!!,This is an awesome phone. Its sleek n beautiful. Dash charging is super fast. Camera quality is amazing. It was packed really nicely. So happy and satisfied with the product.
I Cant Give Anything Less Than 5 Stars :),"This phone is a Beast. I have used Samsung flagship smartphones so far in my life. But recently I felt I am spending lots of money in this apartment and hence I thought of trying out a OnePlus phone. The ""Flagship Killer"". I bought a OnePlus 5 first. Great phone great performance. I used it around 4 months, then this one launched. The OnePlus 5T. I know there is very minimal differences between OnePlus 5 and 5T. Majorly the bigger screen at front. I couldnt resist myself. I love big screens after all thats what I stare at all day. So if the OnePlus 5 had any drawback it was the older look with bigger bezels. So without thinking much I traded my OnePlus 5 for the new OnePlus 5T. And I have no regrets. OnePlus 5T can be arguably the best smartphone of 2017. It got everything, I have the 8GB version, its beast. I feel it never gonna struggle in the performance department it has more power than what it needed. And I love that display. Now its bigger with new aspect ratio. I stated watching all movies on my phone rather the laptop. Still there are some letdowns like the camera. Definitely its very good but not great like some other phones in the market. Thats okay we cant have best of everything. I am totally satisfied with the phone and l would recommend to anyone. If you dont want to spent 80k for an new phone then dont think too much and buy OnePlus 5T because you wont find anything better out here."
Excellent Phone. Worth Buy!!,Pros:1. Looks Premium2. Face unlock is swift3. Camera is exceptional. I mean it!!4. Good Battery back up5. Smooth performance6. Humongous screen. Its a paradise for gamer and video/movie watcher7. Stock android experienceCons:1. Could have bundled headphones in the box2. Still waiting for Oreo update3. Pre-applied screen guard is of not so good qualityIf you are looking for a perfect phone. Go for it!!
Just one word 5T is awesome whether its camera or its performance,"my Previous phone was oneplus 3t phone and i was impressed by it and hence decision to buy 5t - Again very impressed by itOnly Glitch is my 3T was updated to Android 8.0 Oreo and 5t is still on Nougat - weird !I am so spoiled by dash charge of 3T that i couldnt go to any other fast charging phone...Just one word 5T is awesome whether its camera or its performance.But at price of 33k, they must atleast provide slot to expand memory - thats  the only CON i see in this phone...Still five stars to it"
A great upgrade from the OP5,"A great upgrade from the OP5 for someone who uses the phone to read a lot. The only negative downside is that the battery lasts a little less longer (few hours less). However, the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. A great upgrade from the OP5."
Value for money #topnotchof2017,Writing this review after 2 weeks of usage..Battery - last easily upto a day and more (moderate usage)Performance - butter smoothCamera- very crisp and clear even in low light (zooming reduces somehow quality but not an serious issue)Built- slim and handling is easy on handWas very confused to select mobile as dis is d first one plus  company mobile for me .But I did the right choice over Samsung ..Any 1 planning to buy it with having budget 33k go for it without hassle free.
Absolutely rocking,"Superb value for money. Ultra slim design. Superb display. Camera quality superb enough to give my DSLR a tight competition.18:9 format helps reduce the width, thus making it easier to hold, compared to my earlier Nexus 6.8 GB ram is more than what my laptop holds!!!Incredible battery backup.Altogether, superb value for money. Dont think twice to buy this one."

One of the best on the market,One of the best phones that I have bought till date. Saw starwars movie last week. Exclusively for oneplus customer with free pop corn and pepsi @ PVR forum. Other companies should think of Thier customers as well

Superb Value for Money,An excellent phone. I upgraded to oneplus 5T from S5 and the new larger display + increased speed is a breath of fresh air. Great phone and excellent value for money. The Star Wars customization was what tipped the scale for me as I weighed buying a similarly priced android phone from different companies.
Brilliant phone. Really snappy,Brilliant phone. Really snappy. Its been a smooth experience since i bought it. It comes with a pre applied screen protector and and a black translucent back cover as well. Best part is the dash charge.it charges 0 to 100 in around 50 mins. And the battery is big enough to last an entire day.
Awesome phone,"Awsome is the word. Good camera, while in low light it clicks some ok photos. Playing games awesome. Face unlock and finger unlock too is the fastest. Awesome screen. Thank you Amazon and OnePlus for bringing this mobile."
Great Value for Money,"Excellent display. No lags whatsoever.The minimalistic bezel is a great plus in n terms of the design. Great value for money.However, the camera is a bit disappointing. Photos are not that great as compared to those captured in Google Pixel / iPhone X."
Amazing Product with all the specifications at this price,Amazing Product with all the specifications at this price.. no other mobile comes with snapdragons 835 processor at this price. Face unlock is very secure and is very fast.. How ever there are also some deficiencies in the product like1. No front flash for night time selfies2. Phone is not water resistant3. Camera quality not as great as expected4. Battery capacity should have been more
Amazing buy.,Amazing buy... The phone is just too fast and the Amoled display just lights up the phone.Camera is too amazing. The portrait mode provides such great depth to photos that you cant stop clicking them.Video Slo-Mo is great too.The Snapdragon processor 835 is inarguably the best. No heating issues and in fact everything works so smooth.Sleek design makes it look so elegant in your hands. Its a MUST BUY.
Value for money.,The first thing I love in this the screen.I think this the best value for your 33k.Everyone review channel mentioning wireless charging in this device but I think we dont need that charging because my device charge it full in one hour and around.The best thing about 5t is rear camera set up. But about disappointment from front camera because it wont capture in wide angle.But overall its an amazing devise till now experience.
Awesome phone. My previous phone was MI Max,"Posting this review after all most 1 month use. I bought it early prime sale. Awesome phone. My previous phone was MI Max. That was quite big phone.. but I love 5T, user friendly easy to handle. I can feel the change. Only problem which Im facing sudden app close, I dont no whether it is hardware problem or apps. Becoz of this Im giving 4 starts. Cameras are awesome, front facing camera is amazingly clear."
This is an amazing phone with no bloatware unlike others,"Have been a Samsung user throughout before switching to one plus. This is an amazing phone with no bloatware unlike others. I am happy and amazed with the phone with regards to the battery, design and almost everything. One plus has a dedicated team who hears community and work on creating a phone that user wants unlike big brands who works to make more money. Would definitely recommend this phone without a second thought."
Great delivery and exchange experience!,"Recieved the product within 18 hours, and exchange was hassle free. Have only been using the phone for a couple of days now but so far so good! Have only charged the phone for 20 mins in the past 2 days, and the battery is going strong, which is a huge change from the earlier phone!"
Excellent mobile for now and next year,"I have been using mobile over a month now. As of now per inoovation available in market, this has perfect hardware spec and performance. Particularly camera 3d effect. Amazing! As if DSLR is in hand, love to take pics now. Mobile is very fast may due to optimised hardware and 6gb ram. 6in screen with 5.5 inch traditional mobile size, very handy.. finally its thin and low weight..great mobile to own for next 3 yrs, provided Oreo and Android 9 updates are available.."
Best for the price.,"Bought this after exchanging the OP3. I think the display is what makes this phone absolutely magnificent. The battery life is insane! You get minimum 4hrs SOT.Its light, premium and feels good.The camera is average. Yes it is average in low light. To he totally honest, its bad in low light. Even the portrait is meh. Software updates may improve that."
Worth buying it,"Awesome product. Its features are too good. Very sleek and slim mobile, dash charger is one of the best things. Just 30 mins is enough for a full charge. Camera is more than expected, very great pix clarity. Overall, a great satisfaction for the customer."
Top Notch,"Perfect Smartphone with Highest Specifications and smoothest Android Software Experience.Loudspeaker Volume is very high, just Quality of sound is not as good as Pixel Phone(Only Con is No Stereo Speakers.)Extremely happy.Dash Charger......best best bestest ever."
Brilliant Phone,"Brilliant all round phone... Excellent performance, display is superb and a good camera for the price point.. Face unlock works surprisingly awesome"
Nice phone to buy,"Its an awesome phone which has good  performance, good displayBut the camera is fine compared to iPhone or pixel,Amazon delivered it in time"
Good job OnePlus,A great phone indeed. Loved the  camera and the dash charging is great it charges my phone 0 to 100% in less than an hour. 33K worth spent.
Best phone ever,"I brought this phone for my dad on his birthday he paid the bill but girf from me and I must say this is the best phone I had ever seen used in my life . Perfect can describe one plus 5T in one word .My dad always used to say that why these phones are so costly and are they even worth ? I think he got his answer .He loves this phone .The features I think this phone got are -1. Charging speed ,If you never owned a flagship phone in ur life than believe me you would be stund by its charging speed its incredible .But I would point out one thing that the battery life isnt that great but kind of average .2.user interface ,If you love stock Android like I do, you would love one plus 5T.3.Snapdragon 835 is a beast doesnt matter how heavy a game is it would crush it like candy crush .4.Camera .I love its camera its super fast and pexilation is a never seen friend ."
Design ....to the level of  the hype created....,Excellent design...faster performance ..sleek look.Camera yet to use & evaluate...The  two useful features i am missing form my lenovo K4 are ( hope i have searched it enogh ..)1. Flip to screen off2. While the call is in progress & you put the caller on speaker.... speaker again goes off auto as you take phone close to your ear
Mind blowing device.,"The product was delivered on time! The packing was great. Product condition was top notch. Everything about the phone is great. Except maybe the back-facing fingerprint sensor. It works like magic, but I personally dont like a back facing fingerprint. Face unlock Is really fast. Marvellous job by One Plus. A slight heat up in playing really RAM consuming games, but thats understandable. Overall, its a great device ! Certainly go for it."
The best phone in 2017 for the 33k you spend,"Moved from Nexus 6 to One Plus 5T and using this for the last two months.  It is the best bang for the bucks in the price range. The total 33k it is worth in all aspects. People mentioning no IP 67 rating and all should be told that it is just the numbers and I recently used it during a speed boat ride where it was splashed with waves quite so many times and still it runs damn smooth without any issues. Those who pick up this device will be very well aware of the specs and that need not be told. Only thing, please buy a good phone case (even though it ships with one) as the device is slippery and you dont want to see a cracked 18:9 screen soon after you start enjoying those movies on this device."
Very very good phone,Shifted from Iphone 6s to one plus 5T.. was hesitant initially.. But 5T nailed it.. super smooth.. blazing fast.. beautiful phone and great display as well.. did not find any lags/slowness till now.. starting to love this.. Face unlock works just fine.. (Sometimes in rooms with low light it does respond after a few secs except that it works decent ) We anyways have a finger print authentication as a backup.. very good purchase..
AWE-INSPIRING PHONE,"The mobile is awesome.I am in love with it.The phone is a value for money.I would recommend anyone to buy it.The phone never hangs, the camera is awesome.All in all a great phone .THE FACE ID IS DOPE. It is too fast.Thanks to my brother kamaleswar gogoi for recommending it."

Awesome Phone!!,"Awesome Phone, very sleek, light in weight, has all the nice features, screen size is good. Face unlock is a breeze!!! works perfectly every time. Only downside (may be for me) is the vibration strength is a bit on the lower side, even set to the strongest, that can definitely be improved, so that we dont miss calls. Else, if you are looking for a 6inch screen and good value for money, this is the phone to buy, not required to compare with any other model at all."
Powerful and beautifully designed,"Good phone... Using from almost about a month... Extreme gaming, extreme surfing and movies.... Beautifully designed and extremely powerfull...Was expecting oroe update in December itself but seems one+ is going to take their time for that..."
Never Settle One Plus,My first one plus device. I got it on first primw day sale and review after 2 day of usage.Battery 9/10Screen 10/10Sound 9/10 (Im big fan of Dolby atmos sound missing it)Awsome gaming experience.No heating problem.Various LEDs.Fast performance.Im in love with it.Buy it if your budget is 30-40kYou wont regret.
"Worth every penny for its software, speed and battery. Dont expect too much from camera.",6gb ram model is enough.. If planning to buy 8 gb ram model then take a look at Google pixel 2. In good lighting condition photos are good. You will see the painting effect in some pics.Secondary rear camera is rarely used as it comes in action in low light scenarios.Still it is fastest device in the list.
Just wow??,"I am using this phone around a month now and I am totally amazed by its features. I bought this phone from amazon at a price of 33000 Rupees.Talking about performance, this phone has Snapdragon 835 octa core processor. Multitasking on this phone is very easy and smooth. No lagging issues are there while switching between different apps..."
Good to buy,R you looking for speedy and long battery phone?This is right for youI had one plus one and now one plus five.Very impressive performance and specs
My one plus 5T phone,"I have used other phones like Samsung, Lenovo & Motorola. But this one plus 5T stands apart from all of them. Very smooth performance. Camera is excellent. No warming up of phone even after long time use. I was deciding on to get whether iphone 7 or one plus 5T. But then my choice went to oneplus 5T. Nice phone!"
5T - T for TERRIFIC ?,Hands down it is one of the best phones of 2017..No other phone can match the performance of this device.Its suuuper FAST.. If youre looking for a new phone ? in this price range.. I would clearly recommend you to buy 5T.And pls dont call it FLAGSHIP KILLER.. It is a FLAGSHIP but at Affordable price thats all ??
Super!,"Loving this phone! Screen size is amazing, camera is great and works so smoothly. Battery seems to drain a little quickly though."
Near to perfect!,Nothing to complain after a month of use. Just one thing that I want in this phone is separate network mode for 3g and 4g. Now it has one option ie 2g/3g/4g. Otherwise its a perfect phone. It will defenitely make you happy. Buy with confidence.
One word - Awesome,"This is a real good phone. Have been using it for 5 weeks, and its been very pleasing so far. The feel is very premium. Picture clarity, sound quality, speed, smart features, camera - everything is a wow. Couple it with a black flip cover and the look is an absolute class. Per se, One Plus product is known to sustain its performance over its entire life span. And also, dont forget to buy the insurance, lest you might regret your handling damages (I am quite prone to dropping my SPs). And dont forget to order it from Amazon."
Four Stars,"Good for the money. However, nothing exceptional about the camera. Was expecting a better quality"
... waiting for LG V30+ to be launched but Im happy that i bought one plus,"It has been 2 months that Im using one plus 5T although i was waiting for LG V30+ to be launched but Im happy that i bought one plus, its really a value for money which a buyer look for.If anyone having a budget b/w 33-38k then its suggestion that dont see here and there just go for one plus 5t.Thanks Amazon."
Go for it.,Superb.Awesome camera.Faster than iPhone x.Good to watch videos.Better buy 8gb ram model.I recommend all to buy this one if you are looking for premium phones under 40k.
The best phone I have ever used,Best performanceBest cameraBest viewFace unlockFastest unlockingMax customisation.Better to buy two OnePlus 5t than iPhone xI cant describe in words.Simply impeccable
Every thing about phone is good except camera,Every thing about phone is good except camera. Dust is entering in to the camera and quality of the camera is also not good performance of the phone is fabulous still display and speaker need to upgraded.
Awesome Delivery was early Product is top notch nd the ...,AwesomeDelivery was earlyProduct is top notch nd the lava red is awesomeAfter using 8 days Oh man its fast as bullet....Camera is a charm and no glitches till now and I m confident about the future also... Just waiting for the Oreo update...
The best iPhone alternate!!! Quality Personified.,"The best phone purchased (obviously). I can hardly believe that these specs and build quality are available at this price (although not as affordable as other alternatives), given that other flagships slap on a ton of addon features and charge 2x to 3x the price. Camera Low Light Performance still sucks though."
Overall a Great Buy!!,I received it within 24 hours. Been using it since 2 days and till now the only thing let me down a bit is Camera as it is not what I expected but still pretty good. If you talk about the performance then this phone is a beast and electric fast. Overall a great Buy!!
my first impression is its a awesome phone.,"I was using one plus 5, n I upgraded to 5T, using this phone since last one week, my first impression is its a awesome phone..Prose: beautiful design, battery backup, super fast, smooth ui, thin, cameraCons: front camera should have been slightly betterShould be basselless borders"

Must buy,If you are not a blind follower of Apple... this phone is just for you. Everyone knows the crazy specs this beast has so m not gonna pin point there. Just adding my experience here as i came from ine olus 5 to one pkus 5t. It has everything thing from smooth processor to great camera. Near to stock android experience due to Oxygen OS makes it more wonderful. After using the Oxygen OS you might not want to go back to company OEM skins such as those of Samsung Oppo vivo.Hands down the best phone to buy below 50k.
"Nice display, 18","1. Nice display, 18:9 is definately better.2. Camera is getting better with every software update (I will take it positively ??).3. Processor, RAM, ROM is beast as displayed.4. Process handling needs to be optimised but it didnt really effect this beast.5. FaceID is really fast and incredible."
Early Delivery & Excellent Packaging,Everything is just perfect inside out from box to phone as well as the accessories. Just Excellent. Partnership between OnePlus and Amazon should continue in future for best Delivery and excellent goods.
One plus 5t is the best.,Amazon you are superb.. thats why I am your prime member and buy everything from this site. Almost everything. One plus 5t is something like a piece of heaven. Excellent phone to have for daily usage with brand name like one plus
Battery work half day only!!!!!!! with no games and no heavy application,"I am happy with the delivery and phone really works well.Switching to one application to another, camera performance, sound quality, and above all for its charging time is really less.But I am concerned about its battery performance.I use this phone for calling and little bit internet surfing and for the whole day I put it on stand bystill not working more than a day, it works only half day. Anyone else also faced battery draining issue and any resolution for it?? Please suggest!!!"
Awesome phone. Its a power horse,Awesome phone. Its a power horse. Flagship for real. No issues with the phone.I didnt get the HDFC cash-back. Amazon has promised that they will process the cash back by 3rd of Feb. waiting for it.
Good phone,Been 20 days since I am using one plus 5T.Looks gr8Both front and back cameras are goodFinger print unlock is super fastOverall performance is excellent.The only negative is that finger print unlock is at the back side of the phone. Very inconvenient.Overall happy with the phone.
WooooooooooooW,"No Words....Just Awesome !!!Perfection at its best :-)My first OnePlus phone...Man...they nailed it.The best user experience in all department , be it camera, performance, battery etc.- Thumbs Up !!No second thoughts...Just go for it."
OnePlus really hitting target msrket with best in class product,"This is my 3rd used and 6th in series purchased ....OnePlus really hitting target msrket with best in class product ... (OnePlus 2 is only exception ?)Suggestion : u have to also re launch OnePlus X with inifinty display, this will be a very big hit too.Keep up guys."
Amazingly beautiful piece of technology,"This phone have everything in it, it beats iPhone and Samsung and other crap out there, seriously this phone flies like a jet, the camera ?, the screen, the speed, dash charging, 3300mah battery, when I say it flies it mean it flies."
Slim and sleek machine,Good performance oriented phone. Writing the review after 4 weeks of usage. No lag and hesitation even to open heavy graphic oriented game apps. Finger print sensor and ambient light sensor are most liked. Battery lasts one complete day with extensive usage.
Phenomenal Gadget,Thanks to one plus and Amazon team for this phone. Awesome features with super fast RAM and processor. Great phone within this budget. Dont know why people invest 100k on iPhone x they should buy this phone which cost them less than half with allmost same features. Thanks one plus foe this great product.
Best anroid phone in market,"The best anroid phone, no lagging issues, fair battery backup, no hanging issue. I have been using this phone almost 3 weeks now.128 gb gives sufficient storage, dash chargers helps in quick charging of phone...Previously using iPhone 7.Value for money"

I love this phone love you 5t,Its beautiful and very good device from 1+
Absolutely Amazing!,"This is coming from a pre Redmi Note 3 user. Everything about the phone is mind blowing. Right from how light in weight the phone is, to the Anodized aluminium back to the beautiful 18:9 display. After seeing the Dash Charge in action , I cant imagine life without it. Best thing to spend money on!"
Big fan oneplus5t,One plus 5T is just amazing latest smart phone. I received my order just last week still exploring its amazing features. Speed excellent. Multitasking is really very good. Battery life too good even after whole day use.camera very good in low light. Video recording just superb. Big fan of one plus just amazing....
Perfect?worthy?5 star?value for money,I think this ph is perfect guys! I really like it but i would recommend 128gb variant instead of 64gb if your pocket allow. Dont think twice guys if you are thinking to buy smartphone just go for this..this is a perfect device and worthy.
Best phone in this price!!,"I have been using this phone for a week now, i have to say that if you are looking for a phone like iphone x or samsung galaxy s8 in less price, go for this phone."
Its a good buy.,"Its a very good product, been a OnePlus customer since 2015. Camera is quite good, screen and display calibration is very good. Performance is fast and snappy. Its a good phone for the price point. Amazon took a lot of time to deliver the product, very dissatisfied with there delivery scheduled."

Complete all rounder,Best phone at this price . No match for the battery and performance . Camera is a trade off . But its worth everything else . A complete all rounder than iPhone x and galaxy s8 .  pixel 2 has an edge in the camera and stock android segment . But I would recommend for everyone for this price
Awesome mobile. I switched from IOS to android and ...,"Awesome mobile. I switched from IOS to android and this is the first time Iam using android.

this is one of the best android phones out there,"As youll probably have read, this is one of the best android phones out there. Coupled with the OxygenOS, youll definitely be a satisfied customer. The camera needs some work, but I dont see that as being a limitation you cant fix with a software update. Overall, a pretty good and economical deal."
Very good product. But..,Its a very good mobile phone. Fast and good screen. Design is elegant. But.. the sound quality is poor for both inbuilt speaker and WiFi speaker. Ive installed Dolby program but didnt change much. I hope this will be improved soon.

Super,"Simply brilliant. Display is great, performance even better but what I like the most is the dash charge, especially given I am upgrading from OnePlus one. Wish they had bundled a better quality case with it, the curret one catches smudges like a magnet. But surely a flagship killer at less than half of what a lesser specced, unnecessarily hyped premium phone costs."
