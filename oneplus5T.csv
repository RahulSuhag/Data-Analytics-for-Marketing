"Trust me you won't regret (from a 15 day heavy, rough, reckless user. )","It's worth every penny you spent. The camera is awesome but don't start comparing it with pixel 2 XL or iPhone x. Because remember you are paying half the price of those phone's. The screen looks awesome and very vibrant despite being only a 1080p display unless you are using a VR headset. Low light photography is actually improved. Build quality is pretty good, feels premium. Don't ask about the performance, it's just a killer in that section. I pretty use my phone to a extreme limit like playing music,games,messaging,downloading all that stuff simultaneously & the phone executes it like a piece of cake. I'm impressed by how it handles multitasking. As of now it's been 15 days & still no heating issues so far. Watching videos in this device feels awesome, seriously 18:9 aspect ratio makes you love your phone even more. And yeah! the dash charging surely it really helps you during emergency, once you use it then you will understand the love that I have for dash charging. Only thing that I wished in this phone was IP certification for water resistance, but hold on the other day my little brother slipped my phone into the water bucket then after drying out all the water from my phone(using hair dryer) voila it was back to it's original state. But please don't start experimenting with this device because it doesn't recommend water resistant certification but still it gives you some amount of protection toward splashing which is really a good thing. If i have got to recommend anybody to buy a best phone(2017) which covers all the spectrum then my friend this is the phone. Trust me you won't regret (from a 15 day heavy, rough, reckless user. )"
Five Stars,Awesome...just love it....and thanks to amazon for super fast delivery.
One plus 5t just a good mobile,"Good mobile but don't expect miracles from it if ur not social networking user or student coz in that case It will just a mobile with good displayPrevious Mobile Mi Note4I miss d Mi UIOP5T#Camera is pretty good#Processor is good#No heating issues#A full charge can give u 1.5days for average userDash charger is boon for father like me who'sChild not give enough time for charging ,?#front camera is also good#slim n easy to handle with one hand n lightweight#display is good but not exceptional#finger print recognition is not that good as mi note 4#face recognition was very fast at some point in low light but sometimes doesn't recognise in bright light not expected from OP"
Heavenly.,"The OxygenOs is an absolute treat to use. The phone is faster than ever. The YouTube videos regarding its face unlock cannot be more true. It packs a strong processor with more than enough amount of RAM enabling high performance and multitasking. The battery is not so great though the accuracy of dash charging compensates for it. The gameplay is absolutely phenomenal. The rainbow reflection some people were talking about is hardly noticeable. The camera is top-notch. Be it dark light photography, portrait mode, pro mode or documents, its results are extremely satisfying. The fingerprint scanner is at a very comfortable position and the display adds to its aesthetic build.However, i expect an Oreo update soon."
"As they say in The Office, A Win-Win-Win scenario","First of all, I am using the phone for about 3 weeks now and my initial conclusions are provided below. However, I think a little background will be helpful for some perspective.I was eagerly waiting for the Galaxy A8+ to launch and was 90% sure about buying it, mainly of the points I am about to mention:#1 Camera is recessed from the back plane and not protruding outwards. This is a big deal for me.#2 IP certification, which we don’t know will be needed or not but having it doesn’t hurt.#3 Service quality is definitely better, at least in terms of presence.But the following facts veered me towards 5T:#1 There are three things you need to know about Oxygen is. It’s fast, fast and super fast. I certainly am enjoying this right now.#2  Samsung A8+ looks ugly. It’s as simple as that. But maybe that’s just me.#3 Dash charge. Read about it. It boggled my mind that other manufacturers don’t do this. I am sorry I can’t explain to you about this elaborately in this forum but if you are serious, go google. The speed is insane, yes, but the concept and execution by one plus even better still.The phone is super fast, screen is insane, guaranteed second look and positive reactions by others about the phone. I didn’t know face unlock could be that fast. Again, have to experience it. Even the youtube videos that I saw can’t justify it. The phone charging I have already talked about and the battery is also pretty good. I can go on and on but other users have already covered a great deal about this. I definitely am super satisfied and would recommend it to my friends blindly.But just as important are the ones that I am about to mention:#1  The camera protruding is a bit of an issue for me as I wear jeans and ride bike on a daily basis, and other users have posted pictures that show dust under the camera lens. It won’t be visible when checked daily but you look closely at it after a year’s use and Wham! it’s got scratches. It certainly did with my HTC and I am pretty sure it happens to all brands. I just wish all manufacturers used the Sony Ericsson K810i as their model.#2 The charger provided in India ranges from 200-240 volts, so low voltage and international compatibility can be an issue.#3 I really would have liked the option of external memory. It’s not a matter of storage issue as much as a security/convenience issue. You can pretty much take out the card and lend the phone to others, or don’t have to copy everything when upgrading. Or to transfer data, just take out the card and lend it to others without having to lend the phone itself.In conclusion, I am happy I bought the 5T and I was proven right by one plus team. I mean, Oreo in a flagship :) , not that I will be upgrading anytime soon."
Best features with nominal pricing,"A great phone which can easily compete with i phone x.I am writing this review after using it for 2 weeksPros: 1.Very sleak design, light weight and metallic finish takes the phone to a whole next level. 2.Processor, which never hangs in any of the complicated apps that you may use.3. Camera quality is one of it's USP.4. Dash charging can get a 75% charge, just in 15 mins from 0% battery.5. Face recognition is working absolutely fine and touch sensor at back is neatly made.Cons:1. Battery gets drained within 8 hrs, with a normal usage.2. The phone gets heated to an extent.Overall, it's one of the best phones to invest, without much research reqd."
EXCELLENT WITH THIS PRICE :),"FROM 2012 I AM USING ANDROID MOBILES. AND DAY BY DAY ALL GETTING UPDATED.

A Great Phone Worth Your Money,"I bought this phone after checking many reviews. I compromised on few things due the price it carried. Below are the pros and cons after 1 month of usage.Pros :* The phone is superfast. Without any lag ever. This was seen in all areas. Even connecting to wifi and somehow 4G speed is better. I have unistalled many apps and never seen uninstallation screen.* Face unlock is magic. With the screen light option it even works in extreme dark conditions. It cannot be tricked and is amazingly fast.* The battery and charging are also very good. I normally start charging from 20% and stop around 80%. This charge happens in no time. And battery is equally good. I love dark themes and amoled screen helps it. I keep waiting to charge the phone as my last phone had battery problems. I use saavn in office and watch atleast an hour of videos when not in office.The battery survived my work day even when it was at 66% in morning.* The screen is great , my previous phone had IPS display. Also, this may be a compromise for people who have used phones with UHD screen.* There are many settings to personalise the phone.* A great point and shoot camera with portrait mode.Cons :* Box did not include headphones.* One speaker. My previous phone had beats audio with two speakers. So this was a let down.* Night mode, zoomed photos are not so amazing. This was known to me. Panaromic view is a disappointment with multiple vertical lines introduced in the photo.* The biggest con is Oneplus itself. I think they are not working on security. There have been two instances of breach from the time I purchased this phone. One with the credit card and other with data getting send to China. And Oneplus has not taken these two seriously. If they want to survive in the flagship phones market, they have to do more than what they did.This my first Oneplus phone, the phone is good. But i will wait and see where company wants to take itself. For person buying a flagship phone security is everything."
"Superb! Top value for money android with 90% of the features which ivy-league devices have to offer, at half the price.","Excellent phone. I'm very happy with it. Best bang for your bucks. The in-hand feel is spectacular. Devices felt very well balanced & the weight distribution is almost spot on - this is something which Apple has executed well in the past. Glad to see OnePlus paying attention to these details. The screen is bright, clear & unless you pixel-peep with a magnifying glass, you won't notice any pixelation. Battery life is also acceptable, lasts for a day & topping it up with the dash-charger is easy-peasy.Photo quality is mostly great under normal conditions and unacceptable in darker situations. But that's okay with me. I didn't pay a small fortune like I would have for getting an ivy-league iphone or a Pixel. Overall, great phone & I don't see myself upgrading or changing anytime soon. This phone offers all the phone I would need for the time being."
Otherwise it's a amazing phone. Keep up opo,Mine was a case of upgrade from one plus 1 to this phone. It was a heartily decision which I feel was correct. Only issue is a minor lag which is there while unlocking. Otherwise it's a amazing phone. Keep up opo !
Best Android Phone it's Price Segment,"Awesome phone, value for money. Stock Android experience. Oxygen OS brings in some good added features which does not come in the stock Android and are very useful in day today usage. Quick charge technology they use is unbeatable in all segments. There is only two thing to regret and that is, it comes only in one or two colour option. Special edition with different colour will launch after 3 months which is the disappointing factor for people who already bought the phone. Second point is every 6 months they launch a new model and obsolete the existing model. Android updates are very slow and it is not like the way they promised during their launch event"
Brilliant phone!,"Brilliant, moving from an iPhone 6s plus to the one plus 5t , moving to Android after quite abit and I'm not disappointed one bit .A phone that gives the iPhone X stiff competition and costs less than half price makes so much more sense , especially in this day and age were technology gets redundant in no time and one feels the urge to change their phone every two years. This product is affordable luxury.I've used it for more than 2 weeks now and I have no complaints .Brillaint cameraSurprisingly loud speaker for music and callsExcellent display may be not as good as the iPhone but I'm not complaining after saving 60kBeautiful cameraDash charge is so so usefulHeadphone jack is a plusOreo update availableThe damage policy is reassuring some one who's cracked an expensive phone can relate, I have had friends who've gotten their damged one plus devices replaced at their door step with 24hoursI'm totally sold. And really satisfied with my purchase"
Excellent phone,Excellent phone.. Amazing battery life. Superb built quality. Basic accessories like back cover and tempered glass already provided..is a big plus point. The OS is extremely fluid.. Camera is to be fallen in love with..Just that face unlock doesn't work in dark. Needs improvement.. Otherwise is extremely quick in 99% of the cases..OnePlus should come out with no cost emi option for 9 or 12 months also apart from the current 3 months.. This would enable everyone to get access to it.
Super se Uper,"It's simply best phone in this budget, face unlock is super se uper, you hardly need to use fingerprint scanner. Overall experience is too fluid, camera is best. Depth effect feels artificial sometime, else works great. Charging is supery fast, it took harcly hour to full charge it. Case bundled is cool and good gesture by One Plus.One star less coz no oreo update, nor promised exact date when it will come."
Good option I made to switch from an iPhone.,"This phone is really a good choice that stands out in performance with the given price point. Moreover I have been an iPhone user for last 8 years and this phone did not give me any hard time in deciding to switch to Android. Also the performance is very good to meet iphones standard of performance or looks. My Android auto works well, my Google chrome cast integrates well, and there are really few more advantages that I am enjoying day to day. Battery level is really really great. I would always carry my charging cable when I had iPhone 6s and now this stands easily for more than a day with even extensive usage. And charging time is from 10-100% happens in 1hr or 1hr 10mins. In overall I love this phone"
Five Stars,
Awesome phone. I love this phone but the delivery ...,"Awesome phone.I love this phone but the delivery is irritating.Pros:Good rear cameraAwesome displaySuper performance and speedOne of the fastest face detection, fingerprintSuper fast chargingCons:Worst delivery... received the package which is damaged. chances that phone may also get damaged. Impolite serviceFront camera is ok but not great"
Fabulous phone no issue,"This phone is so brilliant that it did not have single cons. I had replace this with my iphone and after that I am very happy. Much much better and advance than iphone. Superb camera, speed, muti tasking, Android edge, screen, light weight and many more. A perfect value for money phone."
Beauty and Beast,Bought 8/128 on prime sale. Unboxing and feeling the phone is awesome. Premium look and finesse.Performance.!!.it simply wows you every time you open the device.Facelock has some issues in my phone..maybe updates will fix...but I prefer fingerlock.. superfast.Camera .. great pics in low light..and awesome Colors.Dashcharge... nothing can beat this..Above all value for your money. (Same features iPhone cost you one lac).A powerful beautiful premium beast in your hand.No second thought to buy the upcoming any OnePlus device.
Excellent phone for 33k,"So the phone is awesome. There are other reviews with technical details, so will skip that bit.I bought the 6/64gb option. It works great and don't feel the need for the more expensive 8/128.The look and feel of the phone is good, feels premium and has full screen available which is great. For the same size as 1plus3 I get more screen.Fingerprint scanner is at the back, takes a little time to get used to.The OS is slick and light weight and is a breeze to operate.Camera is much improved although the selfie could have been better. It's not the best camera but much better than previous versions.Charger has become very bulky and is huge.Other than that, the phone is superb and probably the best value for money at this price.I am still trying to figure how to open the kotak account to get the 1yr insurance free."
Go for it.. excellent product.,"This is my first OP product. In simple words 'Impressed'. Face ID was initially detecting with even closed eyes , but the issue got resolved on software updation..Pros are many .. lightning fast,excellent display,no heating at all,good call clarity,finger print scanner is at perfect place,speaker clarity and volume the best I have experienced.camera is performing the job well.. face ID works even at low lights..Battery lasts for a day average.."
Awsome phone!!!!!???,"MY REVIEW AFTER USING THE PHONE FOR MORE THAN 3 WEEKS.Very happy with the purchase till now everything works fine as promised.The best part about the phone is the dash charging... I never really mind charging every now and then because the battery lasts for the whole day on normal usage and even if charge gets over it only takes half an hour to charge it back up to a decent percentage so i don't worry about charging a lot.Camera also works great. Not the very best but definitely works alright for me. Portrait mode works very well. But i do notice a lot of noice in low light condition. I don't know if its a normal thing in phones but i did notice that so just saying it as it is.And the performance is... how do i put it ""extremely good"". Apps load faster than the speed of light?. Software experience is also awsome. I used to use nova launcher prime on my previous device and had planned to use the same on my op5t but oxygenOS was good enough for me so i sticked to that instead.I do notice a few software glitches here and there though for e.g. swiping down from the top of the screen for notification bar is a hit or miss most of the time. Swiping down does not always gets me to the notification bar . So i do struggle with it at times. Also while typing on gboard sometimes i accidentally tap on multitasking button so it breaks my consistency during typing. This never happened before in my previous phone, maybe it's my bad ,but that's that.But these problems would probably get fixed in the future updates and it doesn't bug me that much anyways so it's not a big deal .Overall I would like to say that this is definitely an awsome phone for the price range. But if water resistance and 4k screens are a priority for you then i would suggest to spend some more cash for better phones. LG v30+ is a good bet i think and apparently pixel 2 phones are also available at 49k now.So if you think you could spend that much, then go for these phones instead but for 33k i can surely say that one plus5t won't disappoint you. ?"
"A clean and Powerful phone, which won't let you down","After using multiple Redmi Phones, I decided to get flagship experience. I really liked the performance and in extreme conditions the phone showed it's awesomeness.Even it has a lot of positive reviews all over the YouTube but I will try to give you some cons which I thought that you should know before buying this phone.The first thing is the camera which should have a Lil better. The camera has very real dynamic colours as well as it performs really well in auto HDR but in low light conditions, the details are lost.Oneplus has improved camera performance after recent update and they are continuing the effort to make it more like a true flagship performer.Using it in reading mode gives me pleasure because the amoled screen looks brilliant in black and white and it gives less stress on eyes also.Overall I would give a thumbs up to this phone and the present referral program program add Icing into the cake you could add use my coupons to get extended warranty I am enclosing it as a snapshot.On successful referral of both the codes you can earn up to 6 months Extended Warranty.Post the offer period, both the referrer and referee will receive a confirmation e-mail confirming the activation of the extended warranty as applicable by March 31, 2018.Coupon code for use on purchase of OnePlus 5T (Midnight Black 6GB RAM + 64GB memory): 65SD-B6LG4H-ZQHAU2Coupon code for use on purchase of OnePlus 5T (Midnight Black 8GB RAM + 128GB memory): FZ8Z-ARLN79-A3VG8R"
The Best phone in this price range..!!,"You might think 33K is a huge money,yes it is a huge amount for some but its totally worth it.We get a superb phone with a?Very decent display,the colors are vivid with its sAMOLED display?It has the snapdragon 835 inside.Its so fluid with the oxygen OS inside?The speaker is very loud?The charging speed is extremely fast.dash charging charges my phone in just 1 hour.?The highlight its camera.it dosent have the standard of iphone X, google pixel 2 or galaxy note 8 but for its price range it is awesome?On paper its just 3300 mah but it lasts me for a day easily?It looks superb in its 18:9 ratio display?Fingerprint sensor is lightning quick?Face recognition is scary fast.you have to use it to understand what I am saying aboutWe compare this phone with google pixel 2 and iphone X.The phones mentioned have double the price by paying double the price we just get a better display and a better camera thats it,so i recommend all to take this phone"

This phone is one of the best available in the Indian Market,"This phone is one of the best available in the Indian Market. I exchanged my MotoG4 plus for this and got additional ?5,700/- off. And ?1500/- off the using my HDFC card. So cutting the long story short, I purchased this phone around ten days back at 25,800/- only. You get a protective scratch guard and a silicon back case with it. I have already ordered a sturdy case and a tempered glass for this, since the scratch guard will only protect it from scratches. No headphones provided. Dash Charger is a beast and fully charges your phone in an hour. Battery lasts me an entire day. The phone does not heat up while charging. Photo quality is excellent. Being a blogger, I always need good quality photographs for my blog. Loving the time lapse option for videos. However, the zoom quality is not upto the mark. Display is mind blowing. Face recognition technology is superb! I would say, for people having ?30,000/- as your budget, go for it. 64GB RAM and processor speed makes the experience smooth."
"Its been a month, Very good phone","Its been a month, I migrated from Redmi, One plus is really Amazing the only problem i do see is the camera lens is kept bulky so the lens may get scratches when you keep it on a table or a rough surfaceSuper fast face unlock, superfast fingerprint sensor, super camera effectsVery good phone, I am having 64 GBversion"
Camera not impressive for this cost,"`I got this phone in a box with  damaged corners but amazon delivery agent justifies that all boxes came in same wayLove this phone for its 6'inches awesome display but  the camera is not much impressive ëven after the latest build, portrait mode is lagging for 2 secs after every clickCons:Default SMS app is not working to send messages if the contact number has country code associatedSelfie mode portrait is not available (I am not aware of this before ordering so want to let people know)Camera is poor in low light and only portrait photos looks impressivePortrait mode is lagging, you have to wait for 2 secs after every click , this happens in 5T only"
Five Stars,Awesome cameraAwesome speed
its just the greed for a latest beauty like 5t. Do not have a second thought,This is my 3rd one plus phone after 2 & 3.. i wasn't attracted to 5.. but 5t made me go for it.. even though the need of a new phone did not rise in me considering the one plus 3 i own(absolutely flawless).. its just the greed for a latest beauty like 5t.Do not have a second thought.. this phone is worth buying and has a life time using capability.. unless u get tempted for a new one..
No other phone compares to the OnePlus,Ok..do this phone is so much better than the inflated iPhone for a fraction of the price.. perfect camera for this who love photography and the best part about it for me is the ability to click the picture by just touching the fingerprint sensor on the back.. a lot of thought has gone into the design of this phone and it's paying off
Worth the price,"I used a single camera phone before this. And i am pretty impressed with the dual camera performance.Phone works smoothly and most of the games i have played has been glitchless. With 128gb memory and gigantic 8gb ram it is a monster indeed. I won’t have to worry about storage space anymore. Yippee!!!18:9 screen is a bliss, watching movies or any media on it feels lifelike and bigger with respect to the phone size.Face unlock feature is great and work very well, I seldom use my fingerprint scanner to unlock. It is that good!! Unlocks in less than half a second. Actually as soon as i look at it.Got a silicone cover and screen guard pre-applied, kudos to that!! Thanks oneplus.And about the fast charging, I can’t stop getting amazed by the speed. (Actually found somewhere that fast charging affects your battery’s lifespan adversely) but who cares. It works like magic, and it is not a software tweet, you can tell by seeing at the charging brick, It is massive (yes, it really is).Only one downside for the package is , they don’t ship it with the Earphones. That is the only downside to the package. But overall it is a great great product.Camera 5/5Screen 4.5/5Look and feel 4/5Processing power 5/5"
"Its a ""Captain America"". Trust OnePlus and go for 5T(128 GB)  blindly","The best phone I have ever used. Its is a ""Captain America"". Too Fast, too Strong, too intelligent. Vexed with my past experiences, here are few things I'd like to share about OnePlus 5T -( 8GB RAM | 128 GB ).1. The feels a stronger than Motorola, Nokia. HTC, Blackberry, Sony, Mi, Apple, Oppo, Samsung - Its a classy looking rough and tough device.2. Connects with - Wifi, Bluetooth, 3G, 4G etc - faster than Blackberry.3. Processing speed - Needless to specify the speed of re-opening apps - Minimize an app, open it after 72 hours - App opens as if it was never closed. I've installed a thousand apps, opened, closed, reopened ans so on. It will never disappoint you. Thanks to SnapDragon 835 and 8GB RAM.4. Dash Charging and Battery - 90% in 60 min - 36 hours minimum in full charge on not-so extensive usage. No more worry of battery, And NO heating problem at all. Even if you operate it under sun.5. Display - The BEST6. Camera - 20+16 Main - 16 Front - Works as expected during day - Portrait mode feels great. I can observe grains on the screen and there's a focus problem in  low-light. Slightly, disappointed by its performance during night.7. Sound Speakers -5 Star ( and no heating problem)8. Fingerprint scanner - Unlocks within less than an eye-blink.- If you want a high-end phone, this phone is the highest you can get. That too at 37,999 /- .- If you are confused between Mi Mix2, Pixel 2, iPhone 8,X, Samsung S8, 5T etc. Go with OnePlus 5T blindly. This beast has a Dual-Sim facility and still have an audio jack, besides all the top  geatures."
This is the best phone in the market where you get so much ...,"This is the best phone in the market where you get so much of value at moderate price. The face unlock of OnePlus 5T is insane and works super fast. Pro Mode in Camera is also a plus point and control over the shutter speed, iso, white balance makes photography fun. The transparent rubber case that comes along with the phone is good and helps you prevent serious damage to your phone."
Excellent! Power button placed wring side for me but.,The phone is excellent. Picture quality and speed everything is excellent. But I have an issue with the placement of power button. It is exactly where I hold with my left hand and many times I invariably end up switching off the screen or shutting off the phone completely if I am not paying attention. I would have preferred it to be on the other side. I switched from iPhone 7 and loving it so far otherwise.
Probably the best android smartphone in 30K range,"I did some research and shortlisted 2-3 android models: Pixel2, Samsung s8, Oneplus 5TThe 1st two options were very good as well but i was more budget conscious and Oneplus 5T suited me well.Android Experience-very snappy performance, 6GB RAM-already received Oreo update- Very close to vanilla androidDisplay and build quality- Its a good 6"" screen , not as good as S8 or Pixel2 but decent- Slim phone no bezel- Fingerprint sensor on back and face recognition on front side(its super accurate and fast)Battery/Heating- No heating issue at all- Dash charging is very handy- Overall battery backup is decent (lasts for a day)Camera- Surprisingly very good- Pixel2 is best in the market but this one is not bad at all- day time pics are seriously good"

Simply elegant and a wonderful device.,Simply elegant and a wonderful device...I don't see any cons in the phone looking at the price it is available inand thumbs up to ONEPLUS to sell it at the same price as oneplus 5
Worth it!,"It has been 3 days since I've been using this phone and until now, I've got no reason to complain. Pretty satisfied with the phone.Did some stress testing by running high end games such as injustice and asphalt side by side. Opened multiple apps, no lags or anything.Facial recognition is unbelievably fast, fingerprint is cool too.Battery life is awesome, lasts whole day easily even with high usage. Its my third day and I've plugged it into the charging once(although for short intervals I did plug this in my laptop). The dash charger is also pretty fast and charges your phone in a very short duration.So overall thumbs up."

Simply Superb,"Beauty and the Beast = OnePlus 5T. Already owned an Oneplus 3 for couple of years before I decided to give Oneplus one more change with the 5T. As guessed no regrets. Every thing is easy with this mobile. Considering I got the 8 GB version, it should keep the lags/mis-touches at bay for atleast another couple of years.Please Oneplus dont provide with Buggy updates to make this awesome phone weak over the period of time. We die-hards get oneplus because it is not just value for money but it is peace of mind. Keep up the good work Amazon and OnePlus."
One plus one 5t ...a complete package,"Excellent phone for the price. Most practical and functional. Amazing operating interface. The feel and look is premium, relatively lighter and ergonomically designed. The added feature of face detection is unbelievably fast and beats the premium phones of same feature in the market. Now talking about the picture quality... i really went on to compare few shots taken on this phone with the dslr and was simply spellbound by the quality of pics taken by this phone. The bokeh(portrait) mode pics steals the show. The low light pics taken are astounding. Complete package and value for money. All my 5 stars for this one. One plus manufacturers take a Bow. Add me as a fan in ur club."
"Think before your buy, the sellers are lied!","I have been using this phone for a bit now here is what I have to as a visual content creator.- love the hardware- love a color, pair it with a spegen cover it looks ravishing- Hate the support on insta- upload an image on Instagram the resolution sucks- lot of there bugs that make the phone slow after the Oreo update- low light camera is a myth, the images sucksVerdict: If your buying this phone thinking your saving money, huh no your are not,add few thousand rupees buy a pixel2. Over all if camera is the selling factory plz I am telling you it's not a value for money"
Excellent phone for the money,"Phone is excellent. Operations are smooth. Fast and quick to respond. Extremely fast fingerprint sensor ( like the OnePlus 3). Face unlock works very well , even in relatively low light. The bigger screen is a major plus. Display is good and very readable even in sunlight.But the camera could have been better. Thats the only thing not matching up the hype. Good photos under good lighting conditions, but grainy in low light.Too much software beautification. But with the latest patches camera is better."
iPhone to OnePlus,"Was an ardent fan of iPhone for years & was using an iPhone6 for the last 2 years.. so decision on OnePlus5t was a major change & I am glad that I decided to make that call..10 times faster than an iPhone & 100% satisfied with my decision..Everything is synced in full & no impact on my usage atall, infact happier!"
Never Settle for One Plus 5T's Terribly Mediocre Camera.,"One Plus, a formidable market base in India, with it's surprising One Plus 5T launch had hooked many of its customers to this variant.The One Plus 5T is no doubt the best in the market, but I have a few cons I'd like to share which largely focuses on Camera and Storage Issues.For starters, when you open the camera and zoom into an object or space, with less light or not, the pictures become pixelated and grainy, which bugs users based on on paper promise by One Plus. And what's worse is that, they don't upgrade the software(which is the least they can do)or fix the issues somehow."
OnePlus have got a winner! - OnePlus 5T,"The way OnePlus have come up with 5T is just amazing! The camera which is the main attraction lives up to the hype! The dimensions of the phone are well defined which makes it very handy rather comfortable to use. Well it doesn't have any extra inbuilt features like samsung because you pay for camera, display which is crisp, hardware (8GB RAM/128GB ROM) & durability! Well battery backup also is unexpectedly remarkable and hence i can say that OnePlus has a winner in their hands! Pay half the price of apple's, samsung's and other brands flagship model! I promise you, you will be satisfied!"
One of the Awesome Phone(1+5T),"OnePlus 5T is one of the best smartphones ever Oneplus consists a kind of attitude in young youth.Oneplus 5T every features mindblowing and I am completely a fan of this phone.superb key features of this phone are1.super camera2.fantastic design3.dash charging4.no heat while playing games(one of the best smartphone for gaming lovers)5.edge to edge displayand so many another cool feature consists of OnePlus 5T.One hidden feature of Oneplus is please try (1+=) in your calculator and see magic(#NEVER_SETTLE).And I would like to thanks, Amazon to deliver this product within 20 hours.""NEVER SETTLE"""
"Its not a phone, its a beast.","If you are confused with which variant to choose then let me you, look for how much storage you need. 6/8 GB Ram is more than enough in your day to day use. There are other flagship phones like Google pixel or Samsung Galaxy S8 edge have 4 GB Ram and they are run smoothly without any lag.OnePlus has evolved in last few years and has earned the trust of users. I am using this phone (128 GB) for past 2 weeks and it is whooping fast, thanks to the mighty Snapdragon 835 processorand Andreno 540 GPU.If you are looking for pros and cons then check out detailed reviews on dedicated youtube channels."
it is awesome. Great speed,"Moved from an iPhone to this after 3 years of usage. Except notifications (which is applicable for Android), specially badges, it is awesome. Great speed, good picture quality and good value for money. Maybe a little more focus on the speakers would be great."
Awesome phone and great service by amazon,"Awesome phone. Had issues with the first order. Amazon was prompt in replacing the mobile. New phone reached me within 3 days.Pros and cons have already been discussed by other customers, but I am totally happy with the product."
OnePlus Beast,"This phone is a bang for buck.. Iam a huge fan of OnePlus as my first product was OnePlus X (beauty).This upgrade is freaking awesome, blazing fast and smooth with this beautiful 6"" screen.A bit excited about Android Oreo update while going through those threads about it.The way I call it is a Beast!!A very big facepalm to those overpriced Smartphone manufacturers.Surely one of the best smartphones of 20th century**OnePlus anticipating the customers for every upgrade."
Honest Review,"I got this phone about a month back and I am extremely pleased with quality of OP. The phone feels sturdy, well built and strong. However, I think the grip could have been better and I found myself to be worried when using the phone with one hand.Coming to the display, I switched from a LCD display so I was literally mesmerised by the crisp details of an AMOLED.The camera is also one of my favourite things in my 5T it takes extreme details even in low light. But, the potrait mode could have been a bit better.I hope this review helps someone seeking honest advice. Thanks."
"Dont think twice, just go for it. ?","Flawless work on the device. Its the best thing you can have in high end phones.It is super sleek, very comfortable to hold.Doesnt lag or make you wait. The software is rocking.Battery is top of the line. Easy 8 hour screen on time which is very very difficult in any other high end device.Games work beautifully without a hitch. Just loving it.Camera could have been better.. Everything bout Oneplus 5T is just ???"
Great phone it can do any task which we throw ...,Used almost all the phones till now but one plus has made its own branding a unique style with simplicity. Great phone it can do any task which we throw the only downside is the camera algorithms camera is good but after processing in certain cases are quite aggressive which finally results in some cartoonish effect. Rest wil gove 5 stars as software bugs can be resolved. Get the 6gb variant as there is not a big difference between the speed. If one needs extra space then go for the 8gb variant otherwise 6 gb is best.
I am happy with the purchase,"After using for 2 weeks, I am happy with the purchase. UI is very snappy, no lags at all, played multiple games, saw videos - I got good battery back of a day with heavy usage. Call used to drop couple of times and had to struggle to reconnect where my earlier Samsung phone used to work  flawlessly - I hope it is one off case or gets fixed in some updates in future.Only issue I am facing is to carry the bulky charger with me always - due to dash charger and type C cable. OEM OnePlus chargers are very costly."
iPhone Killer For Sure,"I love this phone. I am migrating from iPhone and I never thought I will start using Android again. However, due to the high costs and lack of good reviews of iphone x, I decided to check out Android again.This phone is awesome. It is super fast and is loaded with features. I am still exploring and loving it more and more."
It's a Bea5T,"The best of OnePlus had offered ?? previously I had the OnePlus 3 and that was amazing experience !The latest flagship OnePlus 5t offers the best features for the right budget .Worth for the money dude ?While other brands focus on the technology , user satisfaction and money but for OnePlus technology and the user satisfaction is first ???Camera , Display , speaker , oxygen os , battery and many other features  they are performing well ..I have no issues with it ..Thanks OnePlus ?? online review for OnePlus 5t ..It's a Bea5T?"
Value for money.. buy it!!,This is an awesome phone. Its sleek n beautiful. Dash charging is super fast. Camera quality is amazing. It was packed really nicely. So happy and satisfied with the product.
I Can't Give Anything Less Than 5 Stars :),"This phone is a Beast. I have used Samsung flagship smartphones so far in my life. But recently I felt I am spending lots of money in this apartment and hence I thought of trying out a OnePlus phone. The ""Flagship Killer"". I bought a OnePlus 5 first. Great phone great performance. I used it around 4 months, then this one launched. The OnePlus 5T. I know there is very minimal differences between OnePlus 5 and 5T. Majorly the bigger screen at front. I couldn't resist myself. I love big screens after all that's what I stare at all day. So if the OnePlus 5 had any drawback it was the older look with bigger bezels. So without thinking much I traded my OnePlus 5 for the new OnePlus 5T. And I have no regrets. OnePlus 5T can be arguably the best smartphone of 2017. It got everything, I have the 8GB version, it's beast. I feel it never gonna struggle in the performance department it has more power than what it needed. And I love that display. Now it's bigger with new aspect ratio. I stated watching all movies on my phone rather the laptop. Still there are some letdowns like the camera. Definitely it's very good but not great like some other phones in the market. That's okay we can't have best of everything. I am totally satisfied with the phone and l would recommend to anyone. If you don't want to spent 80k for an new phone then don't think too much and buy OnePlus 5T because you won't find anything better out here."
Superb phone and quick delivery,"Ordered on Sunday evening and delivered on Monday morning that too by standard delivery! Amazing Amazon. The phone itself is the best budget flagship phone on the market hands down. If within your budget go for it, the phone exchange process too is painless. I am loving this phone and face unlock works so well!"
Camera if there is another word for superb awesome. Lag it doesn't know,I know a day is too early to say But I Bet to say this it's a beast as am surrounded by few more people with same device .It's incredibly stylish slim . Camera if there is another word for superb awesome.Lag it doesn't know . Yes at 33k it does sound high but if u see with Apple or Samsung you won't regret .
JUST GO FOR IT.,"I am using this from a month now. Using One plus 5T is itself very fun. Camera quality is awesome. All the apps are running fine. Battery backup is also good. Dash charger is a blessing. Full charged in 30 minutes. 6' screen makes it super sleek sexy. Finger print sensor is working fine. In 38K, you don't want anything else. JUST GO FOR IT. :)"
one of the best in class even during in dark Performance,"Five star for the Team of One plus and AmazonNow an honest review of the product, when it comes about other phones having similar kind of specifications in much cheaper rate we all get confuse that which product should be opt for and why to pay extra. So here after using this beast I found myself incorrect bcoz the quality does matters and there one plus stands on top of all.Pros:Camera: one of the best in class even during in darkPerformance: No lag observed kudos to 6 gb of RAM and processorScreen: awesome color display and 18:9 is just fantastic with gorilla glass 5 protectionSensors: all of the sensors are working fine and no lag observed so farBattery: a single charge even after heavy internet use can easily give you backup for more than of one dayCons: Selfie camera doesn't have bokeh effect( correct me if I'm wrong)Small bugs : no inbuilt music app except Google play musicNo automatic dnd mode, no memory card support, no headphones provided, price should need to be under 30k or an accidental insurance should need to be provided by one plus under the rate."
Never settle,"An amazing phone. Worth all the money spent on it. Sleek, blazing fast, face recognition works beautifully even in low light, cameras are awesome, display is really good. Truly a flagship killer I suppose. I'm really enjoying my new phone. Would totally recommend this to everyone. It makes no sense to shell out more that double of what this costs on so called flagships when you can get more of everything than those at this price. It's like they say. Never settle."
Don't listen to iPhone users.,"Awesomest phone I have ever used. Cam quality is superb. Remember every iPhone user will be jealous of this phone and will tell you not to buy one plus, it's a Chinese company blah blah blah.. Don't listen to them this phone will take you way ahead of them. Because you are getting all of it in 33k. Totally worth it."
OnePlus 5T - Value for money,Writing this review after 2 days of usage (6GB RAM version)1. Excellent smartphone/ look/feel/device and screen aspect ratio.2. Great performance/speed.3. No overheating observed. Yet to explore it's gaming performance.4. Quick/ Dash charging is good.5. Easy/quick face and finger print recognition.Minor complaints1. Mobile back case and screen guard  provided for 6GB version are not great. Could have been much better.2. Battery life is good but could be improved further for continuous mobile data usage/ON.
Powerful and Advance Phone.,It is the most powerful and advance android phone. 18:9 ratio screen soothing to view videos and pictures. Oxygen OS is near to stock android which gives good experince. Both camera is superb. Multitasking is flawless. Speaker output is loud and clear. Everything about this phone is awesome at this price.
DAAAAYUMMM WHATTA PHONE!!!,"I am beyond happy with this buy. If the thousand+ positive feedback/reviews do not convince you to buy this monster, I don't know what will.Yes, the hype is real.Yes, the reviews are legit.Yes, this phone is badass."
Good phone and bad Amazon experience,Great phone. But Amazon delivery was bad. There was a total miscommunication between delivery guys and Amazon cs when asked about the delivery.About the phone- posting after 2 weeks of use.Build quality is good. You get a plastic case inside the box which is not enough to protect the camera. You would probably need to invest in a good case as the lens is protuding. There is a scratch guard already present. Also the screen is Corning Gorilla glass. The screen and case are prone to fingerprints. So a case is a must.Speaker also works decently.Dual sim-jio and Vodafone work greatUnlocking by face or fingerprint works accurately.Dash charging is amazingly fast.Front camera quality is amazing.The rear camera is average. The portrait mode is average in low light and amazing in outdoors.Overall a good phone. Probably you should wait for one plus 6?The 2 stars which were deducted are because of Amazon service.
The Value King!,"The OnePlus 5T is clearly a winner in all aspects.I've been getting consistent 26-30hr battery performance (Location permanently set to high accuracy, switching between 4G and WiFi, medium to heavy usage), the screen looks great and performance is on par with the flagships(if not better).The camera could be better but is good enough for everyday shots.It's a clear, reliable and stylish choice for people looking for high end performance at an affordable price."
Just awesome still few issues,"The best in class.The phone is good in everything that a owner needed.Having the powerful Hardware and optimised software is a great pleasure.I recommend it to everyone who looks a performance orientation phone in this category.(only)#Display is awesome ( do not its 1080p not quad hd)#Battery backup is good and the fasted charging rate than any other flagship.#No lag and  over amount of ram so no apps force close.#Good sound speaker and call clarity.#Design is awesome with good metal build, quite light weight.But there is not everything too right-Cameras(selfie+back) are really good in lowlight (consider the price). Also daylight pics are good.But the problem is the pictures are not too detailed when zoomed in images. ( beauty mode is agressive which spoild genuineness). Most peoples say it oil painting effect.Also the video recording is good but front camera has very low field view(zoomed in) in vodeo.So I would suggest better to go for honour v10 for camera lovers.#2 nd majour problem is that there are not perfect tempered glass and even the official tempered glass is not perfect. But I think most devices nowadays have that problem (2.5d glass).I am just loving it and refer it to anyone if they don't need the perfect cam phone. Its that awesome."
Perfection all the way,"This is the most perfect android device out there which can compete with an iPhone (switching from apple, as am not happy with iOS11).Everything about the device is awesome except for the low light camera performance, which is also not bad compared to other phones at this range. but since they claimed it to have it improved so much with that secondary camera i had high expectations and it was a bit let down.Apart from that I am glad i waited a while for this one. definitely recommended as an happy customer."
There is some issue with the speaker after 15 days ...,There is some issue with the speaker after 15 days although there has been no damage to the device.The speaker starts buzzing when there is some notification sound and on ringing .
Best smartphone till yet!,This is the best smartphone till yet.... ?Camera is great (but do update you phone cos it has some improvements for camera)Battery life is okay. Charge it and it juices up for a whole day.Dash charge is fantastic. Superb way to charge your phone in very less time.Display is too good and love the finger sensor at the back (ease of use).Over all its a great phone don't think and go for it. You won't regret!! ??
Awesome :),"Such an awesome phone... I haven't tried anything other than Samsung before... A new phone this is to me.. and it's nice to use, really!... The camera quality is good.. depth effect is good... Speed is great.. there is no lag at all.. overall, would recommend to everyone :) This phone is worth your money for sure :) !!"
Nice phone,"Overall Nice Device.Good points:Excellant Performance,Nice battery backupDisplay is good.Bad points:Camera picture on dim light is not very good"
Finally feel upgraded !,Timely delivered.The phone comes with super clear large display. Sleek body and the design will keep you amazed.Good battery life and high quality picture clarity.Speakers are way better than my previous phones.Overall the experience is very good and I feel contented with my purchase.
Blazing fast fone jus go for it...,"Nice super fast fone, good for gaming, every one better buy 128 gb version, no heating whatsoever, camera better than previous one plus, doze mode has been implemented well just like iPhones, almost no idle battery drain, I miss the front fingerprint sensor of my OP3."
Five Stars,Undoubtedly the best mobile in the market currently.Bought this product after researching for months and was 110% satisfied with it.Just buy it without even giving it a second thought.You will be satisfied in every way possible.
but product is very good..,I ordered this phone 2 weeks back...received on time....packaging was week....but product is very good....OnePlus 5t is an amazing phone...just the back cover provided with the mobile is not good because it is damaging the skin of the mobile ...white spots are appearing on back skin of mobile... Cover all excellent mobile by one plus....loved it
Best value for money phone in mid range bracket,Rated the best value for money phone of 2017 and deservedly so.• Vivid and sharp AMOLED display• Wonderful battery life• Dash charging is amazing• Face Unlock (though not new to Android) works extremely fast and well in a wide range of lighting• Android Oreo about to come to the OnePlus 5TOverall a very good buy for the mid range price bracket providing a near high-end experience.
Flagship Killer,PROS1.Brilliant Display2.Fast and Safe unlocking3.Extremely fast UI4.Big Battery Life with ultra fast charging5.Pure Android and Clean UICONS1.Too slippery without the cover2.Camera quality not upto the level of pixel/Iphone/s8/note.3.Updates are not on timeConclusion: A great smartphone with lots of feature and lag free performance.A phone I would recommend to anyone with the budget of 30 to 40k.
Speed,Awesome phone for this era and value for money. Case provided is great. Go for it if better options not available at the time. Clever battery and performance optimization thus lightning fast charging and processing. Nice ester egg.
Best Buy For 2017,"Took a while to get used to such a good phone. Blazingly fast, simply refined, brilliant camera... Lots to like. You have to use it to know just how well it performs, like a charm. Order via Prime sale, came in under 24 hrs and since never been set aside. Check out more reviews of it. And don't believe the hype that it's not good enough. The others are way too expensive to compare and still this trumps them.Blindly do go and pick this. You'll regret you thought of anything else."
Excellent phone no heating at any time while charging and ...,"Using since a month, Excellent phone no heating at any time  while charging and Charing and talking.Can choose which application should use the mobile data network  , as in iPhone. I left iPhone due to double sim requirement.Mobile cover + Screen guard is supplied, but NO HEAD FONE"
It is a very good phone in a Price budget of 35000,It is a very good phone in a Price budget of 35000. As one plus is giving everything that a smart phone of 2018 should have. Camera quality is superb and bokeh effect is good too. Performance wise it don't lag and battery performance is also decent.The users who like to play a lot of games then it is a good phone for them as it didn't heated much and didn't lag even on games like Nova.So far it is a very good phone to buy in a Price budget of 35000
GREAT PRODUCT 1+5t,Blazing FastBoth Delivery was done in less than 24hours of orderMay b advantage of being PRIME customer....Product is really good impressive I feel somewhat is 5t bit taller may b t for tall ..but is absolutely stunning display...Great work by OnePlus Hope u improve the camera performance bit betterAssistive lighting face unlock is totally blazing Fast...now can unlock in full dark area...Kudos again..
TAKE IT AND GOOO,"BEAST !Huge jump for me after using my OnePlus One for 3 years.OnePlus has produced a beauty of a smartphone with the new 5T.Will take time to adjust, having a huge display. But this beast doesn't disappoint.Pro's:Face ID (Ultra Fast)Fingerprint sensor (Ultra Fast)Headphone Jack is still there !Con's :Could have used stereo speakers"
A must buy mobile.,"A must buy mobile if you are looking for premium segment mobile without paying a lot.When you think to buy new mobile with new 18:9 display , dual camera, better design, smooth operating software and fast charging, only One Plus 5t deserve the no. 1crown ?.What is best in this phone.. its not hidden, when you see first time you just going to love it, big display with amoled screen is worth spending time on it. Oxigen OS is so simple that every one can experience easily. Face unlock is undoubtedly fastest, just see n unlock, forgot about fingerprint sensor you never want to use again after using face unlock. Dash charging is mind blowing fast, plug it take a walk n done. Even battery backup is so good if you are working person and no time for gaming or other stuff then no need to charge again for next 2 days. Reading mode on Amazon Kindle is one of favorite thing while using One Plus 5t. Camera and Portrait mode is so good no complaint.What to say more big and better display, fastest response whenever you touch and use. Finest camera and video. Fast charging. Sleek and beautiful design. One Plus 5t has all things to make a phone bold and beautiful."
Worth buying it,"Awesome product. It's features are too good. Very sleek and slim mobile, dash charger is one of the best things. Just 30 mins is enough for a full charge. Camera is more than expected, very great pix clarity. Overall, a great satisfaction for the customer."
Top Notch,"Perfect Smartphone with Highest Specifications and smoothest Android Software Experience.Loudspeaker Volume is very high, just Quality of sound is not as good as Pixel Phone(Only Con is No Stereo Speakers.)Extremely happy.Dash Charger......best best bestest ever."
Brilliant Phone,"Brilliant all round phone... Excellent performance, display is superb and a good camera for the price point.. Face unlock works surprisingly awesome"
Nice phone to buy,"It's an awesome phone which has good  performance, good displayBut the camera is fine compared to iPhone or pixel,Amazon delivered it in time"
Good job OnePlus,A great phone indeed. Loved the  camera and the dash charging is great it charges my phone 0 to 100% in less than an hour. 33K worth spent.
Best phone ever,"I brought this phone for my dad on his birthday he paid the bill but girf from me and I must say this is the best phone I had ever seen used in my life . Perfect can describe one plus 5T in one word .My dad always used to say that why these phones are so costly and are they even worth ? I think he got his answer .He loves this phone .The features I think this phone got are -1. Charging speed ,If you never owned a flagship phone in ur life than believe me you would be stund by it's charging speed it's incredible .But I would point out one thing that the battery life isn't that great but kind of average .2.user interface ,If you love stock Android like I do, you would love one plus 5T.3.Snapdragon 835 is a beast doesn't matter how heavy a game is it would crush it like candy crush .4.Camera .I love it's camera it's super fast and pexilation is a never seen friend ."
Design ....to the level of  the hype created....,Excellent design...faster performance ..sleek look.Camera yet to use & evaluate...The  two useful features i am missing form my lenovo K4 are ( hope i have searched it enogh ..)1. Flip to screen off2. While the call is in progress & you put the caller on speaker.... speaker again goes off auto as you take phone close to your ear
Mind blowing device.,"The product was delivered on time! The packing was great. Product condition was top notch. Everything about the phone is great. Except maybe the back-facing fingerprint sensor. It works like magic, but I personally don't like a back facing fingerprint. Face unlock Is really fast. Marvellous job by One Plus. A slight heat up in playing really RAM consuming games, but that's understandable. Overall, it's a great device ! Certainly go for it."
The best phone in 2017 for the 33k you spend,"Moved from Nexus 6 to One Plus 5T and using this for the last two months.  It is the best bang for the bucks in the price range. The total 33k it is worth in all aspects. People mentioning no IP 67 rating and all should be told that it is just the numbers and I recently used it during a speed boat ride where it was splashed with waves quite so many times and still it runs damn smooth without any issues. Those who pick up this device will be very well aware of the specs and that need not be told. Only thing, please buy a good phone case (even though it ships with one) as the device is slippery and you dont want to see a cracked 18:9 screen soon after you start enjoying those movies on this device."
Very very good phone,Shifted from Iphone 6s to one plus 5T.. was hesitant initially.. But 5T nailed it.. super smooth.. blazing fast.. beautiful phone and great display as well.. did not find any lags/slowness till now.. starting to love this.. Face unlock works just fine.. (Sometimes in rooms with low light it does respond after a few secs except that it works decent ) We anyways have a finger print authentication as a backup.. very good purchase..
Oneplus fan since inception!!,"This is a beast!! Better than any of the phones in the range of 50-60k. Many many features to talk about. Strength and design with power. Just realized today that. Bluetooth even works from 40metres away for a music device!! 40-50%battery lasts for a day easily. What you'd have opened yesterday still opens in the same state today!! Nothing lags!! I bought oneplus one when it was launched within first month, same with oneplus 5t. No regrets ever! I am a OnePlus Fan!!"
You Can't ask for more,You Can't ask for more. Quality at every stage even for the box and sim ejector tool.The bluetooth works much better with my wireless when compared to my old phone.The display is really good. Performance is excellent as its has the best specs now.
For a user like me who jumped from j7 prime to 5T,"Service :Ever heard of fastest service? Yes! That's Amazon. I had to pay Rs. 150 extra for immediate delivery... And it reached me before 11 hours...About the phone :This phone's a killer...For a user like me who jumped from j7 prime to 5T, this phone has a lot of features that are surely gonna surpass your expectations...Camera :Best at low light photography...I guess they have to work on fixing the stability issues on 4k video mode.Dual camera takes a lil while to focus the image...Fastest unlock with face lock even in the darkest room, it actually utilises the screen's brightness to capture.Battery life and charging are excellent!"
Excellent phone but asthetically poor from back side.,"Performance wise excellent.Screen quality good but iPhone is better.Camera quality is excellent equivalent to I phone.External security features is excellent....face recognition, finger print all works  excellent.Not sure abt internal security features.Audio quality of song is good but incoming voice from phone needs to improve.Screen guard on the phone is pre applied which is of  good quality.But aesthetically from back side it looks cheap chineese phone...from front side, phone looks excellent but from back side it looks cheap....back side cover provided by d one plus also looks cheap....To improve this back side, I had to purchase extra 550 RS. Sandy texture  back side cover."
"The best phone to buy in 2017, even when compared to other flagships twice the price.","Hands down the best phone to buy in 2017. If you aren't an apple fanboy and the lack of wireless charging isn't a deal-breaker, you cannot go wrong with this phone.The benefits of a 6inch screen only become evident once you start using it. Enough power to run as many apps as you can throw at it. Battery life long enough to last you the entire day and then some."
Simply Awesome,The best phone I ever had....Lava red you absoulute beauty....Of course the best Android phone in this planet we can describe....worth for every penny but only missing with water resistant . If you have a budget around 30k then go for it without any thoughts.....
"Go for it.... Everything ,yes everything is top notch.","Go fir it , if you you are going to purchase mobile between 33-38k.  Without thinking of for any other device. Dash charge is superb.Hands of for dash charge Good job ??. Oxygen os is also very smooth. I will update after a month use."
Oneplus 5T 128GB,"Awesome screenBattery life is splendid,getting 10 hours of screen on time though no game play.Camera is ok comparing the price of the phonePerformance is smooth, no hiccups experienced.Face id works 70% of times and accurate ,fast but don't work wen light get dim.Overall thumbs up go for it guys"
Amazing OnePlus,"Awesome Phone, premium performance and quality, Camera, Sound, Calling, Display all departments are really fantastic. Couldn't ask for more.. Slightly costly but given the features can't really complain much. If I were given chance I would make it shatterproof and water proof considering the price I am paying these would make the already best phone as unbeatable phone for 17-18 years.. Cheers"
One more iphone user shifted to oneplus,"Review only after seven days.....will modify later. Although it's too early to write it but still, it is a great phone with many outstanding features. Everything is good, unable to find any fault or lag till now."
Best gadget,I never used such an amazing device. This is a true smart phone and keeps my life very simple with very cool features which you will come to know only when you start using it. Steal deal really as this is close to perfect.
Amazing Phone,"This is an amazing phone with awesome specs at this price. The camera quality is as good as it can get. Touchscreen is pretty good and so is the sound quality. I was planning to buy an iphone, but i think I have made a reight choice of buying this amazing phone at ahlf the price of an iphone."
It's a gem of a phone!,"I'm so pleased to have this phone in my hand since I bought it. This phone is super sexy. The standard 8GB model of the OnePlus 5T by itself is a fantastic deal at ?37,999 and the fact that the Star Wars variant costs just ?38,999 makes it an absolute steal. The white color option combined with the red and black accents and the Star Wars logo at the back make the device immediately stand out from the standard variant of the 5T and other devices in this segment.In short, the OnePlus 5T Star Wars edition is a collector's item that offers great value for money. There's not a whole lot of products that fit that bill, so if you're in the market for a phone under ?40,000, act now and get your hands on the OnePlus 5T Star Wars edition while it's still on sale."
Best Android in this range.,Superrfast. Highly efficient. Portrait mode is on spot during day but finds difficultly in detecting in low light. Superfast charging. Full charge at 9.30 in the morning. Comes to around 30% after 12 hours of usage. Facelock is quick but rarely sometimes it is unable to detect. Rarely. Overall best phone in the budget. Bought it during Flash sale and running like Flash.
Superb Mobile,Superb Phone. And the display is big and super clear. Performances was incredible.
OP5T review,"As usual delivery of the product was on time by amazon, but disappointed with a Rs.1/- offer by amazon & Oneplus. I have been with oneplus right from its 1st product launch in 2014 and I recommend Oneplus 5t for its specifications & camera.Pros:Camera (Front & Rear)ROM (64GB)RAM (6GB)Size (6"")Fast ChargeBattery (lasts long for a day with heavy 4G use)Cons:Display has blueish /reddish (it seems to be most of the indian version has this issue ) color when you see it from sideNo expansion slotYet to get Oreo update"
Best smartphone ever!!!!,Best smartphone below 35k Awesome design and look. Camera is just wow??? Superfast charging with dash charger?. Perfect phone.
Great phone....,"Upgrade from 2 years of using iPhone 5s. Great experience with OP 5T and battery life is also good.Gaming also good i was tested these games- Asphalt 8 ,real racing 3 , mordern combat 5 , leo fortune etc. Happy with the OnePlus 5T and Camera is improved after update and click very nice pictures than before."

but the feeling of getting one this year's best phone is an untimate feeling,"Been waited for 3 months, finally received op5t, have seen n number of unboxing and reviews videos on YouTube of this phone, but the feeling of getting one this year's best phone is an untimate feeling.The build quality is very good.Very slick and OnePlus also sent back case thanks for that.The display is beautiful.All I can say I am in love with this device."
The Beast.,"Super fast 'flash-like' delivery. Received the package in best condition. Fantastic phone.. awesome camera. Sound quality is superb. Slow mo, time lapse are super awesome. Please don't hesitate guys...just go for this phone."
Little Disappointment- But Loved it as it's mine anyhow :),Pros : 1. Slim & Weightless  2. Low light photo capabilities  3. Fast finger print & face recognition  4. Speed navigations (so far 3 weeks)  5. Fast Charging in 45 mins to 1 hr maxCons:  1. Not worth for Rs. 37999  2. Camera pic output not as expected  3. Poor sharpening of focussed pics in portrait  4. Worst Speaker like Korean set
Beauty and a Beast!!,Worth the wait and definitely worth the hype!! :)Migrated from the OnePlus one (after 4 years of usage)The change feels good! The force is definitely strong with this one :D
Best phone of 2017....,"OnePlus 5t..it's almost the perfect phone till now.its good looking, well built, incredibly fast, good camera, stock Android, so many other good features are there.Guys..forget iPhone x or pixel XL 2.just grab this OnePlus 5t and you will see the magic. It's highly recommend for everyone, especially for the smartest modern guys who doesn't waste money unnecessarily on iPhone x or pixel XL 2."
Amazing phone,"Display is great, it's not quad hd but works fine even in VR headset you won't be able to find difference. Battery is good 2 days with moderate usage."
"Awesome, honest review from a Apple iPhone 6s user","This phone is a real hype phone.I am a iPhone 6s user and believe me 6s is no any closer to this.camera is mind blowing, bettery is last for a single day,portrait shots are awesome and lastly it's blazing fast.proud to be 5T user,Go for it blindly"
Phone is fine. Display,"I have been using it for 2 months now. Phone is fine. Display, speed and charging is good. However, the camera leaves question marks. Picture quality after spending 33K is not upto mark. If you don't click pics, then go for it. I have had better camera phones at one third of its price. Hadn't bargained for grainy and oily pics."
Awesome phn on this planet with latest chipate and component.,It's simply awesome phn till this date on this planet. No flagship company can beat this phn feature in 39k. Even though it had defeated the stupid iPhone X as u can see though benchmark. Those who prefer iPhone simply wasting there money only to show eliteness although they don't know full opration of it as how it work and iPhone is simply good for nothing in reality.All the component are latest and powerful.
and face recognition is a good to have feature(takes time to unlock if its becomes ...,The delivery of this product was quite smooth...phone is an eye catcher..but camera is just decent.....and face recognition is a good to have feature(takes time to unlock if its becomes even a little dark) ....but for its price it seems a good phone to buy with the latest hardware stacked within it
Just awesome,Super fast phone with amazing sound and great camera.Phone is thin and light weight this makes it more classy.Only a disappointment is it's cover that comes inside the box.Just go for it people.You won't regret.
Battery drain Phone gets heated up like hell Very slow Phone becomes dead slow when Battery ...,"Coming out from a Google phone was a bit challenging.However, the main reason for coming out of my dearest Nexus 6 is as follows.Battery drainPhone gets heated up like hellVery slowPhone becomes dead slow when Battery percentage is less than 30%My One plus 5T did solve all these problems with so much ease with their Oxygen OS and a whopping 6GB RAM.I tested this phone till 4% of Battery but it never gave up and gave me and amazing performance.Thank you One plus!!!!Having Amazon prime is a privilege which helped me get the phone on the next day of launch itself.Thank you Amazon and as usual your services are amazing!!!!"
Amazing product loved the performance,Amazing product loved the performance.. design face recognize feature is amazing .. charging is amazing half an hour more than 70% charge it's really nice and also worth i am really loved the product don't  compare this product with oppo f5 it's mind-blowing infront of oppo it's mind-blowing after using one week I really felt money spent on the 5t is worth .. m really satisfied ...
One plus 5t,"It has everything tech and power one can expect in a smartphone. But a lots of other phones have that too..What makes it stand out of the crowd is the price at which you are getting all the features..The only thing I was slightly disappointed is the average camera..But if you are into clicking cool pics for your social media account, you are good to go with this phone."
A must buy for Oneplus fans,"No doubts about the quality from Oneplus and their after sales support. Indeed 5t is the best one to come out till date from Oneplus and they will keep on improving, i am sure.Only -ve i can think of with OnePlus 5T (Star Wars Limited Edition) is the bulky case they provide with it. I think it is just a waste of otherwise such a good quality case, only because it is too bulky to use on a day to day basis. I can understand they wanted to go with the flow of the theme they picked (Star Wars) but if they had made it slightly thinner, it could have been a great case and my daily driver. But this 1 small issue won't stop me from giving 5 stars to the phone and the company though."
Five Stars,Simply awesome.. Blazing fast.. Camera?.. Everything is just perfect
Five Stars,"excellent finish quality, camera is awesome, battery life great, speed awesome.."
Perfection beyond words!,"I wish there was another star to give. This phone is pure art piece. Just amazing, Speed, Performance, look... Beats it all!! Just floored with the sheer perfection of this device! Thanks OnePlus!"
Excellent,"Excellent.Fullfilled all expectations.Battery,screen,speed,camera.Above all these top class features at a really worthy price.The only one thing I was not very impressed with was the camera quality in low light.It is good but not as good as the ad of OP5T shows.."
Excellent Powerhouse The Best Android phone in Budget...,Very Nice and Fluid phone.Purchased the new Lava red version for my wife.Got the Oreo update today.Can only say feel jealous of her want to grab this powerhouse in my hands...
it's the best phone you can buy now,"The Overall Beast. If you don't consider camera your primary importance, it's the best phone you can buy now. Camera lacks behind Google Pixel 2XL ,iPhone X, Samsung Note8 and S8. On all other aspects Op5T is the benchmark smartphone"
Awesome phone,"Hi friends.. i have changed my iphone 6s with this oneplus 5T.. and m happy with this phone. Between this two, iphone is very handy to use . Oneplus 5T is large to use by one hand.. otherwise its cool.  Guys oneplus 5T is awesome with dash charging.. at 30 to 45 minute its give 100% charging.  You can use 36 hour with full day net...potrait picture quality is very good.. try it."
Beyond the imagination,Very nice product reach my expectations what a nice phone and delivery is to fast 2nd I received my product with careful packing
OnePlus 5T Is One Of The Best,OnePlus 5T is one of the best in its price range ...I have been using this mobile for 2 months now and the experience is awesome ... Unlocking the device is super fast with the finger-print and Face unlock ... with 128gb space you don't need to bother about running out of memory ... The camera will not disappoint you unless you are looking out for professional photography for which you would have to buy a DSLR ... The device fits perfectly in hand and is super sleek so fit right in your pocket ...
This is a perfect next gen phone,This is a perfect next gen phone.. go for it without any second thoughts.. great value for each pennyPros:1. Larger display(bezzleless) gives great screen view2. Great battery life3. Lighting fast performance4. AMOLED screen is a delightCons:Nothing so far
Far superior to most higher priced phones,Buying this phone is a no brainer. Been using mobiles since 2001 and never have been so pleasantly surprised by the capabilities of any phone. The face-id works wonderfully well. The fingerprint module at the back of the phone is very responsive and intuitive to use.Hardly anything negative to say. Battery life is very good.
Total worth of your money!,"As expected very very beautiful phone with beast inside of it. Till now it seems to run very smoothly, dash charging is the best part of it which allows you to charge your phone from 0-60 in just 30 mins, tested successfully. Absolutely loving it! But it would be more convenient if the standard delivery time was faster. Otherwise, no complaint!"
Excellent phone with amazing camera,Camera - 10/10performance - 10/10Look- 9.5/10Design- 9/10Battery backup - 9/10Excellent phone after oneplus 3t.. Using from 1st December--Amazing experience ...Really it is very very great phone in this range ...( bhai log bina soche aankh band krke le skte ho)Go for it... Faaddu phone h ekdum... Jhakkassss
Really this phone is great in all aspects,"I am posting review after use of almost 3 weeks. Really this phone is great in all aspects. Descent camera. I was amazed to see it's photo clear and fine than I phone 7 and vivo v7+ . More over it's photo quality is good in night or low light condition. Speaker quality is superb. Battery backup is 1.5 days in normal use. I think this phone is number one in all other phone particularly great specs in comparative low price. If u choose good specs phone under 20 k but those phone may creat many problems like heating, bad camera quality etc. I highly recommend this phone to buy if one wants all splendid specs in one phone. This is my genuine review."
"Battery drains as quick as the dash charging, aka dash charging, dash draining of battery!!","Not a very good reviewer but can sum up in short that the phone is smooth as butter EXCEPT for the battery. Without using the internet, phone's battery get knocked out in 5-6 hours only on calling. Pretty disappointed with the battery life. Have to charge twice in a day to keeps its soul working."
Strongly recommended. Premium handset for a budget price,An absolute stunner from One Plus. Fares very close in most of the parameters and also outperforms iPhone and Pixel 2 in some. Strongly recommended. Premium handset for a budget price.Downside:Not officially waterproofHD videos not streaming with high quality in Amazon prime and Netflix. This should be fixed in a software update hopefully .

Very smooth, camera is just perfect, the ram is also the best in the market.Overall a wise buy at this range."
Don't think ... Go For it....!!!!,I have used many mobiles.... But this  one is superb... Mind blowing... Smooth... Slim... Excellent... It's really worth to buy for 33k....Battery  back up...  Is outstanding....  Love the dash charging...  Amazing...  Love this mobile a lot
Just Awesome,One of the best phone in the market.Best quality camara and oxygen is ?... Killer looks?
Excellent Android Phone Right Now!!,What an incredible phone in all aspects!!!!My first OnePlus device.Excellent build quality.Extra excellent performance.Excellent camera.Beautifully designed.Last but not least #DashCharge it is one of the fastest charging phone in the world right now.Low battery! Plug your phone! Make a cup of coffee and be amazed!!!! It is too fast.
Android Redefined,"Previously I was using Motorola G3, now I opted for this beast. It's android experience is much better than stock experience. The phone doesn't lag at any point. It's insanely fast and face unlock is spot on. Camera is just fantastic in Day light,it struggles in night but much better than all those budget phones and its peers in that price range. Just go for it"
So far the experience is good. Performance is very good,Bought this phone in Dec 2017. So far the experience is good. Performance is very good..camera is very good..except night photography. Also screen mirroring is a problem.. portrait mode is awesome...screen resolution is good...battery back up is also good.. charging the battery requires only half n hr..dash charger works awesome..over all good deal...
Name is enough,"One plus...5t...name is enough...very light weight...picture quality is very very good,feel pretty and primium in your hand picture quality is awesome...slow motion video is good....I love one plus5t...speeding device...no lagging at all....."
Snappy and great performance,"The phone was delivered on time within 24 hrs of order,Amazon is incredibly fantastic,working fine with latest updated till now,just loved the face detection ,it's snappy n jawdrawooing fast. Just don't go on the offer for protection plan ,it's a forced way to get a Kotak bank a)c opened and in return you don't get it covered incase of loss or theft."
Need for Speed  lovers..No lag..All high end features available..cant say much about batter as of now..Go for it guy's,"Superb Phone..got it on 31st Dec as gift...Awesome speed...great Camera..Worth every penny..All high end phone features are available in it. Foe speed lovers its a boon..Love it !!!!!Have checked many Benchmark results, most of them resulted Oneplus 5T as top performer compared to other high end smartphones at higher price...No regrets..SO far so good.."
Phone is a beast with such a good price point,Awesome phone... Value for money.Pros:-Camera qualityScreenStock AndroidBatteryUser interfaceRamFace unlock is too fast and reliableCons:-Sound is good but could be betterNot waterproof (but can you complain at this price point?)The phone is damn good you can go for it without hesitation.
Excellent purchase for the price.,"Excellent phone for the price range. Been using it for months now. Phone is very responsive. It comes with a transparent silicon back cover, plastic screen guard and charger. Only con here is no Oreo update yet. That's disappointing as OnePlus 3T has got the Oreo update."
Amazing Experience overall . Great phone,"Amazing phone . My upgrade was a big step . Since , I have been using one plus one for a long period now . One plus 5t is just an amazing experience overall . Great battery life , Amazing screen and Great camera upgrades . If you are looking a smartphone to upgrade to . Just go for it !P.s. iPhone x users . You might need a upgrade to one plus 5t"
Loving the phone????,Awesome phone . I just received it yesterday it's so fast so amazing. I am a OnePlus x user I buyback that phone and bought this one . It's so fast than than the OnePlus x and this phone's camera is just awesome. And it's battery backup is also good. I just want to say that OnePlus should keep making these good phone's.
Excellent mobile for the price paid!!!,"I don't ask more for the price paid. Good screen, excellent build quality, top notch specs. Dash charging is at it's best. You can have your mobile 50% charged in just 25 mins. Finger print scanner is blazing fast. Face unlock is also working flawlessly. Audio quality on ear phones is good and it's just okay thru phone's speaker. Front facing camera is excellent and rear camera shots are good, but not great. Overall, it's an excellent phone. Go for it without having second thoughts."
Zing zing Amezing..,"I am feeling awesome, the kind of phone design, switching speed, camera quality, face detection, finger print scanner every thing is working as expected from One plus.Thanks a lot to Qualcomm for providing such a amazing processors..In this price range you never get a good phone better than 1+... So Go for it..it's my strong recommendation.."
Amazing Phone,"6 out of 5 stars. This phone is outstanding. Feather smoot. Lightweight. Have to charge once in day & a half, but I'm not a heavy user. So maybe once in a day & forget battery%. Ample of storage. Glides through the apps with 8 gb ram. No glitches. Star Wars edition is worthy collection. Doesn't feels fragile in hands."
A must buy phone,"When I got the phone,  it was going well but after some time it suddenly stopped working and the screen went blank. I contacted to amazon care. They sent a technician but he also could do nothing. So a replacement  was done.Now the new mobile is very good and the best phone in this budget range.Just a bad luck in the first  phone."
Looks Great and the exclusive theme makes it even better,No doubt the best phone in market today. I am not a fan of Star wars but the white color looked amazing. The protective cover makes the deal even sweeter.Face unlock is so fast it feels magical.Loved the option of opening the payment app like Paytm by long pressing the finger scanner.Playing games has never been more fun.Usage is ultra fast and smooth. No issue so far
Best smartphone till date next to iPhone X within the ...,"Best smartphone till date next to iPhone X within the given price range. Superb camera quality and very fast performance. Hats off to dash charging. Taking 1.5 hours from nill to 100 % charging. After a full charge, it takes around 24 hours to discharge completely although I am a moderate user (using wifi, 4G, camera and video recording, navigation but not played any game). Overall excellent battery life. Face unlock feature is working perfectly as described. Camera quality is up to the mark.But only one problem is that there is some lag around 4/5 seconds while mirroring with a smart TV."
AWE-INSPIRING PHONE,"The mobile is awesome.I am in love with it.The phone is a value for money.I would recommend anyone to buy it.The phone never hangs, the camera is awesome.All in all a great phone .THE FACE ID IS DOPE. It is too fast.Thanks to my brother kamaleswar gogoi for recommending it."

Awesome Phone!!,"Awesome Phone, very sleek, light in weight, has all the nice features, screen size is good. Face unlock is a breeze!!! works perfectly every time. Only downside (may be for me) is the vibration strength is a bit on the lower side, even set to the strongest, that can definitely be improved, so that we dont miss calls. Else, if you are looking for a 6inch screen and good value for money, this is the phone to buy, not required to compare with any other model at all."
Powerful and beautifully designed,"Good phone... Using from almost about a month... Extreme gaming, extreme surfing and movies.... Beautifully designed and extremely powerfull...Was expecting oroe update in December itself but seems one+ is going to take their time for that..."
Never Settle One Plus,My first one plus device. I got it on first primw day sale and review after 2 day of usage.Battery 9/10Screen 10/10Sound 9/10 (I'm big fan of Dolby atmos sound missing it)Awsome gaming experience.No heating problem.Various LEDs.Fast performance.I'm in love with it.Buy it if your budget is 30-40kYou won't regret.
"Worth every penny for its software, speed and battery. Don't expect too much from camera.",6gb ram model is enough.. If planning to buy 8 gb ram model then take a look at Google pixel 2. In good lighting condition photos are good. You will see the painting effect in some pics.Secondary rear camera is rarely used as it comes in action in low light scenarios.Still it is fastest device in the list.
Just wow??,"I am using this phone around a month now and I am totally amazed by its features. I bought this phone from amazon at a price of 33000 Rupees.Talking about performance, this phone has Snapdragon 835 octa core processor. Multitasking on this phone is very easy and smooth. No lagging issues are there while switching between different apps..."
Good to buy,R you looking for speedy and long battery phone?This is right for youI had one plus one and now one plus five.Very impressive performance and specs
My one plus 5T phone,"I have used other phones like Samsung, Lenovo & Motorola. But this one plus 5T stands apart from all of them. Very smooth performance. Camera is excellent. No warming up of phone even after long time use. I was deciding on to get whether iphone 7 or one plus 5T. But then my choice went to oneplus 5T. Nice phone!"
5T - T for TERRIFIC ?,Hands down it is one of the best phones of 2017..No other phone can match the performance of this device.It's suuuper FAST.. If you're looking for a new phone ? in this price range.. I would clearly recommend you to buy 5T.And pls don't call it FLAGSHIP KILLER.. It is a FLAGSHIP but at Affordable price that's all ??
Evergreen Flagship Killer,"Performance best,Camera awesome,Battery long lasting,Slim body,Gorgeous 18:9 display,Superb sound quality,Fastest dash charging,Overall.......""Many dreams, One Mobile"""
"Wonderful phone to buy , totally worth buying","Awesome phone.Totally worth it. I will surely recommend it to everyone.Very fast and crisp display.Changed from iphone 6s to Oneplus 5T. can see the difference that oneplus has created in the android market.Do buy it if you are looking for a phone within the range of 30,000 closing your eyes, it will not let you down."
#AddicteD to OnePlus+,Using it since a month..still every time i pick it up..it feels like unboxed yesterday..no doubt PHONE OF THE YEAR
It's really an awesome one. If you choose the same specs with ...,"Phone with these specs for 37k, you can blindly go for it. It's really an awesome one. If you choose the same specs with big brands like Samsung or Apple, it costs you double the amount or more, just for water resistant feature. Do you play in rain or in a pool just coz your mobile is water resistant? I don't think so."
Best phone in the market right now!!,"Best phone ever.. feels premium in hand, camera is just awesome with depth effect , face and finger lock features are so fast to unlock the phone, even after very long use the battery won't drain out. Many new features added to this device.. I'm enjoying it!!so just go for it guys."
You cannot get these features in this price,"With 8 GB ram 128 GB rom you get blazing fast performance, no need to worry about lags and refresh just open your app and start working. Portrait mode in camera is no less than other high end smartphones and with continuous updations onePlus is trying to make this beauty more powerfull. With these basic powerfull features you get OnePlus advance features like Face ID which is like instant. All you have to do look and phone gets unlocked in milliseconds, and other features like reading model, 16:9 display, 20 mp front camera makes this peice of art and outstanding smartphone."
"Jack of all, King of none.",No words. Speechless!! A high performing beast which can handle anything thrown at it with ease. Camera is above average and not comparable to some of the flagships around. Let's hope updates will fix some low light photography shots. Call quality is good. Speaker feels wrongly placed while game. Yet it is pretty much loud. Display quality is one of the the best though not quad HD. AMOLED display is always a pleasure to watch. The best part of OnePlus 5T is it's dash charging. Phone gets charged way too fast. Thanks one plus for creating a jack of all and king of none. ?
I bought it for camera but was bit disappointed with low light photography,The phone is really good. I bought it for camera but was bit disappointed with low light photography (hence reduced 1 star).Day time photos though are awesome. The ease of handle of oxygen is also good and simple.Dash charge is also great and I got rid of consistent charging my old phone.Will certainly recommend to others.
This is not Just a Mobile its a fantastic package of features and quality,This is not Just a Mobile its a fantastic package of features and quality.I have using from last two weeks. I fell in love with it.Face Lock is so fast.Camera is good. Portrait mode is awesome.Battery runs a day with normal usage.overall having a good experience with the device.
... are going for oneplus 5t I think it's the best possible option in that price bracket of 30000 or ...,It's actually a flagship killer as you all know and thank you Amazon for quick delivery if you are going for oneplus 5t I think it's the best possible option in that price bracket of 30000 or 35000. It has all the flagship features although it does it isn't waterproof.
Must Buy Phone,"I have an s8 and I gave it to my wife after using this phone. Super fast amazing display, out of the world camera. If you have budget buy a 128gb, 8gb varient. Totally value for money"
So far so good,"Complete package. Contains simple case and scratch guard is pre-installed. I would still recommend buying a different case and tempered glass screen protector. They didn't have insurance options with the phone in the pre-sale, and they looked slightly on the expensive side."
Great phone. Very fast and smooth operations,Great phone. Very fast and smooth operations. I bought the 8/128 version. It works like charm. The face unlock feature is also very convenient and fast. I am pleasantly surprised with its charging and it readily lasts me 2 days with 1 full charge with normal usage (I don play games much).
Just go for it,NYC phone in this price range..I would have appreciated if one plus team would have provided for the use of 20mp camera in low light as well..Rest phone is very smooth as far as processor is concerned..Very awesome experienceWorth for moneyEagerly waiting for Oreo update
Five Stars,The best phone I used ever...!!! Awesome build quality and performance... Go for it
Go for it,"The package was delivered earlier than expected and was very nicely packed.The phone is amazing, so responsive with less bezels and is definitely better than oneplus 5 in every aspect.I've recieved three updates for camera and other UI related updates making the experience real smooth.Facial recognition is way too amazing, it's so fast you won't even recognize you've had any password set on you device.Upgraded from oneplus 2 so the experience is blazingly fast and responsive.Highly recommended"
Value for Money product.,"First of all Thanks to Amazon for quick delivery for 150 INR.Now about the phone I was using iphone 6S before and was afraid of switching to Android.To my surprise it is seamless and transitions between the Apps is quite smooth which I personally liked in Apple products.For 38000 INR , 128 Gb with 8 Gb RAm is a deal of a lifetime."

Phone it's been 2 month I'm using phone was one performance and I would like to mention that phone feel down from my height on marble stone ...nothing happen not even single scratch... But I don't know is the phone issue or m health because my eye are paining if I watch for long time...
One word - Incredible,I have been using this phone for about a month now and I will say that I have no issues with this phone. In its particular price range there is no better phone. Just go for this. You will not be disappointed.
Super!,"Loving this phone! Screen size is amazing, camera is great and works so smoothly. Battery seems to drain a little quickly though."
Near to perfect!,Nothing to complain after a month of use. Just one thing that I want in this phone is separate network mode for 3g and 4g. Now it has one option ie 2g/3g/4g. Otherwise its a perfect phone. It will defenitely make you happy. Buy with confidence.
One word - Awesome,"This is a real good phone. Have been using it for 5 weeks, and it's been very pleasing so far. The feel is very premium. Picture clarity, sound quality, speed, smart features, camera - everything is a wow. Couple it with a black flip cover and the look is an absolute class. Per se, One Plus product is known to sustain its performance over its entire life span. And also, don't forget to buy the insurance, lest you might regret your handling damages (I am quite prone to dropping my SPs). And don't forget to order it from Amazon."
Four Stars,"Good for the money. However, nothing exceptional about the camera. Was expecting a better quality"
... waiting for LG V30+ to be launched but I'm happy that i bought one plus,"It has been 2 months that I'm using one plus 5T although i was waiting for LG V30+ to be launched but I'm happy that i bought one plus, it's really a value for money which a buyer look for.If anyone having a budget b/w 33-38k then it's suggestion that don't see here and there just go for one plus 5t.Thanks Amazon."
Go for it.,Superb.Awesome camera.Faster than iPhone x.Good to watch videos.Better buy 8gb ram model.I recommend all to buy this one if you are looking for premium phones under 40k.
The best phone I have ever used,Best performanceBest cameraBest viewFace unlockFastest unlockingMax customisation.Better to buy two OnePlus 5t than iPhone xI can't describe in words.Simply impeccable

Just waiting for the Oreo update...
The best iPhone alternate!!! Quality Personified.,"The best phone purchased (obviously). I can hardly believe that these specs and build quality are available at this price (although not as affordable as other alternatives), given that other flagships slap on a ton of addon features and charge 2x to 3x the price. Camera Low Light Performance still sucks though."
Superrrrrr,"The product is simply awesome,.,......the one plus is the brand which makes the killers of flagship......it was really a never settle...company..,there is no problem..in my mobile.....the package from Amazon is some wat.bad...the package rating was out of 4/5 ....but the product is super.....the ? gives the awesome photos....and the out of 6 gb of RAM I got 3.5 gb....and the ram management was also wondering....but the minius point is the placement of speaker gril...... that's all.... thanks you.. one plus.... thanks you.. Amazon"
Fantastic phone.,Fantastic phone.. till now I am satisfied...camera is awesome...but not expandable sd slot which was not mentioned. Speed is awesome... recently brought so can't comment on quality performance.  .
"Gr8 phone ,.... with costing more money",This is best phone... no complaint juzzzz awsm.. those who are more technosavy .. save their tym.. with med budget go for it... but i want to mention that This offer from HDFC is cost more to your pocket as it charges 18% GST on said EMI .@ Amazon guys please dont  hide such ***** T & C as it ruins your image too in market due to HDFC bank CC.
Definitely Best Buy in today's Smartphone market,"The best phone in market right now, OP5T is a grand changer for One plus, definitely must buy for its tech specs, seamless OS, amazing photography, powerful performance, unbelievable battery backup ? Been using this phone since 21st November the day it released world over..... Seriously get it."
Amazing phone! I have been using 3t for a ...,"Amazing phone! I have been using 3t for a while now and got so used to the home button at the bottom. Feels weird without that, but otherwise it's a lightning fast phone! So damn smooth to operate as well"
this is an excellent device in this price range,"This is from a ex iPhone user, this is an excellent device in this price range. I have been using this for the past 2 days and the experience is not at all disappointing ! The thin bezel display make set great for content viewing as well as hard core gaming. So far I am happy with this product."
Complete mobile,Very nice phone compare to price.Built quality is superbBattery back up is good & complimented by dash chargingDisplay is very smoothCamera quality is like DSLRprocessor is very fastConsFace recognation sometime dose not work if it's dark.
Best phone in the segment for the price.,"For the price, this is the best phone of 2017. I had the 3t earlier which i gave to my wife. One plus phone is really best quality in the segment. Especially, the support forum team is the best as compared to any brand."
Gr8,"Reviewing after almost a month of usage.1. Best Android phone I have used till date.2. Battery, although it's 3300 mAh but goes throughout the day on a single charge. The dash charger takes  30mins for a full charge.3. Camera as we all know is excellent.4. Too slippery without a backcover."
Five Stars,Awsome phone compared to other flagship devices at this price range. I am loving this.Coupon code for additional 3months warranty on purchase of OnePlus 5T (Midnight Black 6GB RAM + 64GB memory): 65QQ-28BJRR-EKELJXAnd  FZMV-JGH2MJ-GQGMGQ
Overall a Great Buy!!,I received it within 24 hours. Been using it since 2 days and till now the only thing let me down a bit is Camera as it is not what I expected but still pretty good. If you talk about the performance then this phone is a beast and electric fast. Overall a great Buy!!
my first impression is it's a awesome phone.,"I was using one plus 5, n I upgraded to 5T, using this phone since last one week, my first impression is it's a awesome phone..Prose: beautiful design, battery backup, super fast, smooth ui, thin, cameraCons: front camera should have been slightly betterShould be basselless borders"

Must buy,If you are not a blind follower of Apple... this phone is just for you. Everyone knows the crazy specs this beast has so m not gonna pin point there. Just adding my experience here as i came from ine olus 5 to one pkus 5t. It has everything thing from smooth processor to great camera. Near to stock android experience due to Oxygen OS makes it more wonderful. After using the Oxygen OS you might not want to go back to company OEM skins such as those of Samsung Oppo vivo.Hands down the best phone to buy below 50k.
"Nice display, 18","1. Nice display, 18:9 is definately better.2. Camera is getting better with every software update (I will take it positively ??).3. Processor, RAM, ROM is beast as displayed.4. Process handling needs to be optimised but it didn't really effect this beast.5. FaceID is really fast and incredible."
Early Delivery & Excellent Packaging,Everything is just perfect inside out from box to phone as well as the accessories. Just Excellent. Partnership between OnePlus and Amazon should continue in future for best Delivery and excellent goods.
One plus 5t is the best.,Amazon you are superb.. thats why I am your prime member and buy everything from this site. Almost everything. One plus 5t is something like a piece of heaven. Excellent phone to have for daily usage with brand name like one plus
Battery work half day only!!!!!!! with no games and no heavy application,"I am happy with the delivery and phone really works well.Switching to one application to another, camera performance, sound quality, and above all for it's charging time is really less.But I am concerned about it's battery performance.I use this phone for calling and little bit internet surfing and for the whole day I put it on stand bystill not working more than a day, it works only half day. Anyone else also faced battery draining issue and any resolution for it?? Please suggest!!!"
Awesome phone. It's a power horse,Awesome phone. It's a power horse. Flagship for real. No issues with the phone.I didn't get the HDFC cash-back. Amazon has promised that they will process the cash back by 3rd of Feb. waiting for it.
Good phone,Been 20 days since I am using one plus 5T.Looks gr8Both front and back cameras are goodFinger print unlock is super fastOverall performance is excellent.The only negative is that finger print unlock is at the back side of the phone. Very inconvenient.Overall happy with the phone.

Phenomenal Gadget,Thanks to one plus and Amazon team for this phone. Awesome features with super fast RAM and processor. Great phone within this budget. Dont know why people invest 100k on iPhone x they should buy this phone which cost them less than half with allmost same features. Thanks one plus foe this great product.

Good product with elegence,"One of the excellent product with technology of this time at convenient price range that keep you along with Google , apple and lg with excellent photography and fast processor clearly visible while searching with ok Google"

The Best Android Mobile Again From Oneplus.,"Its been a day I have received the mobile, but I am already loving it. This is my second mobile from Oneplus, earlier I have used OP3 also for a year.

Very good product. But..,It's a very good mobile phone. Fast and good screen. Design is elegant. But.. the sound quality is poor for both inbuilt speaker and WiFi speaker. I've installed Dolby program but didn't change much. I hope this will be improved soon.
