"Trust me you won't regret (from a 15 day heavy, rough, reckless user. )","It's worth every penny you spent. The camera is awesome but don't start comparing it with pixel 2 XL or iPhone x. Because remember you are paying half the price of those phone's. The screen looks awesome and very vibrant despite being only a 1080p display unless you are using a VR headset. Low light photography is actually improved. Build quality is pretty good, feels premium. Don't ask about the performance, it's just a killer in that section. I pretty use my phone to a extreme limit like playing music,games,messaging,downloading all that stuff simultaneously & the phone executes it like a piece of cake. I'm impressed by how it handles multitasking. As of now it's been 15 days & still no heating issues so far. Watching videos in this device feels awesome, seriously 18:9 aspect ratio makes you love your phone even more. And yeah! the dash charging surely it really helps you during emergency, once you use it then you will understand the love that I have for dash charging. Only thing that I wished in this phone was IP certification for water resistance, but hold on the other day my little brother slipped my phone into the water bucket then after drying out all the water from my phone(using hair dryer) voila it was back to it's original state. But please don't start experimenting with this device because it doesn't recommend water resistant certification but still it gives you some amount of protection toward splashing which is really a good thing. If i have got to recommend anybody to buy a best phone(2017) which covers all the spectrum then my friend this is the phone. Trust me you won't regret (from a 15 day heavy, rough, reckless user. )"
Five Stars,Awesome...just love it....and thanks to amazon for super fast delivery.
One plus 5t just a good mobile,"Good mobile but don't expect miracles from it if ur not social networking user or student coz in that case It will just a mobile with good displayPrevious Mobile Mi Note4I miss d Mi UIOP5T#Camera is pretty good#Processor is good#No heating issues#A full charge can give u 1.5days for average userDash charger is boon for father like me who'sChild not give enough time for charging ,?#front camera is also good#slim n easy to handle with one hand n lightweight#display is good but not exceptional#finger print recognition is not that good as mi note 4#face recognition was very fast at some point in low light but sometimes doesn't recognise in bright light not expected from OP"
Heavenly.,"The OxygenOs is an absolute treat to use. The phone is faster than ever. The YouTube videos regarding its face unlock cannot be more true. It packs a strong processor with more than enough amount of RAM enabling high performance and multitasking. The battery is not so great though the accuracy of dash charging compensates for it. The gameplay is absolutely phenomenal. The rainbow reflection some people were talking about is hardly noticeable. The camera is top-notch. Be it dark light photography, portrait mode, pro mode or documents, its results are extremely satisfying. The fingerprint scanner is at a very comfortable position and the display adds to its aesthetic build.However, i expect an Oreo update soon."
"As they say in The Office, A Win-Win-Win scenario","First of all, I am using the phone for about 3 weeks now and my initial conclusions are provided below. However, I think a little background will be helpful for some perspective.I was eagerly waiting for the Galaxy A8+ to launch and was 90% sure about buying it, mainly of the points I am about to mention:#1 Camera is recessed from the back plane and not protruding outwards. This is a big deal for me.#2 IP certification, which we don’t know will be needed or not but having it doesn’t hurt.#3 Service quality is definitely better, at least in terms of presence.But the following facts veered me towards 5T:#1 There are three things you need to know about Oxygen is. It’s fast, fast and super fast. I certainly am enjoying this right now.#2  Samsung A8+ looks ugly. It’s as simple as that. But maybe that’s just me.#3 Dash charge. Read about it. It boggled my mind that other manufacturers don’t do this. I am sorry I can’t explain to you about this elaborately in this forum but if you are serious, go google. The speed is insane, yes, but the concept and execution by one plus even better still.The phone is super fast, screen is insane, guaranteed second look and positive reactions by others about the phone. I didn’t know face unlock could be that fast. Again, have to experience it. Even the youtube videos that I saw can’t justify it. The phone charging I have already talked about and the battery is also pretty good. I can go on and on but other users have already covered a great deal about this. I definitely am super satisfied and would recommend it to my friends blindly.But just as important are the ones that I am about to mention:#1  The camera protruding is a bit of an issue for me as I wear jeans and ride bike on a daily basis, and other users have posted pictures that show dust under the camera lens. It won’t be visible when checked daily but you look closely at it after a year’s use and Wham! it’s got scratches. It certainly did with my HTC and I am pretty sure it happens to all brands. I just wish all manufacturers used the Sony Ericsson K810i as their model.#2 The charger provided in India ranges from 200-240 volts, so low voltage and international compatibility can be an issue.#3 I really would have liked the option of external memory. It’s not a matter of storage issue as much as a security/convenience issue. You can pretty much take out the card and lend the phone to others, or don’t have to copy everything when upgrading. Or to transfer data, just take out the card and lend it to others without having to lend the phone itself.In conclusion, I am happy I bought the 5T and I was proven right by one plus team. I mean, Oreo in a flagship :) , not that I will be upgrading anytime soon."
Best features with nominal pricing,"A great phone which can easily compete with i phone x.I am writing this review after using it for 2 weeksPros: 1.Very sleak design, light weight and metallic finish takes the phone to a whole next level. 2.Processor, which never hangs in any of the complicated apps that you may use.3. Camera quality is one of it's USP.4. Dash charging can get a 75% charge, just in 15 mins from 0% battery.5. Face recognition is working absolutely fine and touch sensor at back is neatly made.Cons:1. Battery gets drained within 8 hrs, with a normal usage.2. The phone gets heated to an extent.Overall, it's one of the best phones to invest, without much research reqd."
EXCELLENT WITH THIS PRICE :),"FROM 2012 I AM USING ANDROID MOBILES. AND DAY BY DAY ALL GETTING UPDATED.

A Great Phone Worth Your Money,"I bought this phone after checking many reviews. I compromised on few things due the price it carried. Below are the pros and cons after 1 month of usage.Pros :* The phone is superfast. Without any lag ever. This was seen in all areas. Even connecting to wifi and somehow 4G speed is better. I have unistalled many apps and never seen uninstallation screen.* Face unlock is magic. With the screen light option it even works in extreme dark conditions. It cannot be tricked and is amazingly fast.* The battery and charging are also very good. I normally start charging from 20% and stop around 80%. This charge happens in no time. And battery is equally good. I love dark themes and amoled screen helps it. I keep waiting to charge the phone as my last phone had battery problems. I use saavn in office and watch atleast an hour of videos when not in office.The battery survived my work day even when it was at 66% in morning.* The screen is great , my previous phone had IPS display. Also, this may be a compromise for people who have used phones with UHD screen.* There are many settings to personalise the phone.* A great point and shoot camera with portrait mode.Cons :* Box did not include headphones.* One speaker. My previous phone had beats audio with two speakers. So this was a let down.* Night mode, zoomed photos are not so amazing. This was known to me. Panaromic view is a disappointment with multiple vertical lines introduced in the photo.* The biggest con is Oneplus itself. I think they are not working on security. There have been two instances of breach from the time I purchased this phone. One with the credit card and other with data getting send to China. And Oneplus has not taken these two seriously. If they want to survive in the flagship phones market, they have to do more than what they did.This my first Oneplus phone, the phone is good. But i will wait and see where company wants to take itself. For person buying a flagship phone security is everything."
"Superb! Top value for money android with 90% of the features which ivy-league devices have to offer, at half the price.","Excellent phone. I'm very happy with it. Best bang for your bucks. The in-hand feel is spectacular. Devices felt very well balanced & the weight distribution is almost spot on - this is something which Apple has executed well in the past. Glad to see OnePlus paying attention to these details. The screen is bright, clear & unless you pixel-peep with a magnifying glass, you won't notice any pixelation. Battery life is also acceptable, lasts for a day & topping it up with the dash-charger is easy-peasy.Photo quality is mostly great under normal conditions and unacceptable in darker situations. But that's okay with me. I didn't pay a small fortune like I would have for getting an ivy-league iphone or a Pixel. Overall, great phone & I don't see myself upgrading or changing anytime soon. This phone offers all the phone I would need for the time being."
Otherwise it's a amazing phone. Keep up opo,Mine was a case of upgrade from one plus 1 to this phone. It was a heartily decision which I feel was correct. Only issue is a minor lag which is there while unlocking. Otherwise it's a amazing phone. Keep up opo !
This is the best product out there at this price point,This is the best product out there at this price point.Camera selfie and main are very very good. Zooming makes images and video grainy. But its unfair to compare this phone with Apple samsung  etc.Audio loud speakers are loud but i rarely use them to listen to songs.UI is quick thanks to snapdragon processor and 6 gb ram.Video playback is clear. No lags. youtube does not utilize the full width of screen. Perhaps app update from youtube is awaited.Yet to check out phone performance with heavy graphics games.Dual sim works flawlessly. No issues with basic phone functionality bluetooth wifi.But only flip side of this slim good looking phone is vibration effect which is less.Face id and fingerprint security is extremely fast
Superb,An exclusive edition of the one plus 5T. No difference in terms of specs with the original 5T. A phone for the star wars fans. The white with the red star wars branding is brilliant and so is the kylo ren themed cover which is quite sturdy even though it won't lay flat on a surface. It comes pre loaded with star wars theme as well as wallpapers both of which will probably come to play store from third party ppl soon.A good buy since it costs only 1k more than the original 128GB  5T. Go for it if u r a true star wars fan or prefer a phone which does not look the generic black as most phones do nowadays.
Good phone,There is a lot of scope for  the improvement of daylight photos and portrait mode.However the overall performance of phone is exceptionally goodRating-Camera 7/10Battery life 9/10Processing speed 10/10Display 7/10Software 8/10Dash charging 10/10Audio quality 9/10Value for money 8/10
Move away Samsung n Apple..here comes one plus.. best phone in market,Completely satisfied.. an ardent Samsung user with great regret I compromised myself to buy dis phone instead of the Samsung s8+.. but after a week's usage im glad I saved that xtra 20k bucks.. move away Samsung n Apple.. Here is oneplus .. a flagship in the making.. people considering of the Samsung s8 stuff pls think twice dis phone s worth ur valuable money xcept a few misses here n there u ll love dis phone..
Great value for money,The phone is awesome. It's very fast and no heating issues. Face recognition works really well and battery lasts for more than a day for my usage.
Three Stars,this phone had created more expectations while reading specs but not in real working conditions
The best you can buy at such a price.,"Awesome smartphone at a good price....My review after using the phone for 20 daysPros*Awesome camera ,specially lowlight*Battery life is very good....i am a heavy user and still the phone manages to pass a day with ease and survives till the next morning.......*No lags no hangs 8 gb ram is what makes the phone works smoothly even tough if u have a ton of apps open.Touch is very responsive.*Charging is very very fastCons-Speakers on the bottom....sometimes they get blocked by the hand or surface while using the phone.Back built quality is not up to the mark......altough ive been very cautious and careful,even have the back cover on the phone from day 1 still it has got minor scratches and its anntenna rubber thingh also has got a lot of scratches at the back even after heavy protection.Conclusion-This is a perfect smartphone for such a price.It has top notch features and does not fails to  amaze you with its performance and features.You womt feel like keeping the phone away its soo amazing.If the above cons are not a big issue for you guys then go for this phone.At first i was going in for google pixel 2 xl then i thought to give this beast a try and i dont regret my descision at all."
Beast in performance...... Lovin it ONE PLUS 5T rocks,"Excellent product and a beast in performance....Upgraded from my Old Sony Xperia Z3+ dual  (3GB RAM) to this One plus 5T (8GB RAM), its just superfast and DASH charger OMG its a beast in charging the phone in 60 min which will last u a full day.128 GB internal no SD card required. Face recognition in also amazing and of course camera is a top notch in this price segment.AMOLED display is a treat when u have a 18:9 display....Sleek look make it a Sexy machine to use.No lag, no lapse = Best performance via Snapdragon 835 processor.and to end we have face recognition and fingerprint scanner which is fastest in flagship."
No doubt the best phone,"No doubt this the best phone anyone could buy in 2017 although it does my have a pure android like the Google phones or the Motorola phones the stock android has its own advantages. There are many gestures which are awesome and the finger print scanner is amazing it unlocks at lighting speed . If you are an android lover and stop looking here and there just go for it . Also the camera is good with he new oxygen update has enhanced the optical stabilisation by which I can take steady video even while moving . One of the best things is if u want any software enhancement u keep it in the o eplus forums inbuilt app and if they like your recommendation they would add that feature in the upcoming update .Overall this is ""THE BEST PHONE EVER"""
Practical and modern phone,"Lets start with cons.1. Software has few bugs that can annoy on day to day basis.. like auto-rotation, brightness is too low on auto mode, despite I own 8gb varient, buttons response like text or calls is slower than my friend's iPhone, and Bluetooth sometimes suddenly disconnects from my audio device which didn't happen on my previous phones. (am sure all these can be fixed)2. Charge on the phone stays for almost a day.. am a student and as I am a heavy user.. most others may not feel so but with OnePlus we would expect it to last longer.3. Camera- portrait mode is a crap at most situation as far as I have used.. and Shutter lag comparing with flagships.. s8 and iPhone 10 were really fast at shutter..4. Some of might face trouble with the charger as the brick is huge.. check pictures for references.THESE ARE THE FEWEST OF THE NEGATIVES TO SPOT ON THE PHONE.. AND NONE OF THESE WOULD PROBABLY BOTHER OTHER... And most of these can be fixef with an upgrade.On to the PROS,1. Design is very practical. Wil easily last for longer time than an iPhone 10 , s8 and other flagships + it's sleak, beselless and modern!2. Camera does wonders from slowmo to lapse and every other feature on the camera is brilliant including low light photos... Sharp and clear.. a normal photo is very clear and perfect unlike the s8 which enhances contrast levels to keep the details..3. User friendly.. reason for me to buy this over a v30,.. many customisations possible, you wouldn't believe how user friendly this phone really is. It can do more than any other in the market and does not have unnecessary stuffs that could annoy us easily.. oxygen os on Android is the best for user interface.4. Dash charging . 1 and half hour from 0 to 100.. before this all my phone had charger next to bed and I slept and used the phone with charger..but with OnePlus 5t I haven't had to worry about charging.. go for shower and by the time you are back it has more than half juice already!!!5.face unclocks even before you realise.. and same with finger print.. both make my life so much easier. As mentioned.. phone is 100% user friendly"
Best Android Phone it's Price Segment,"Awesome phone, value for money. Stock Android experience. Oxygen OS brings in some good added features which does not come in the stock Android and are very useful in day today usage. Quick charge technology they use is unbeatable in all segments. There is only two thing to regret and that is, it comes only in one or two colour option. Special edition with different colour will launch after 3 months which is the disappointing factor for people who already bought the phone. Second point is every 6 months they launch a new model and obsolete the existing model. Android updates are very slow and it is not like the way they promised during their launch event"
Brilliant phone!,"Brilliant, moving from an iPhone 6s plus to the one plus 5t , moving to Android after quite abit and I'm not disappointed one bit .A phone that gives the iPhone X stiff competition and costs less than half price makes so much more sense , especially in this day and age were technology gets redundant in no time and one feels the urge to change their phone every two years. This product is affordable luxury.I've used it for more than 2 weeks now and I have no complaints .Brillaint cameraSurprisingly loud speaker for music and callsExcellent display may be not as good as the iPhone but I'm not complaining after saving 60kBeautiful cameraDash charge is so so usefulHeadphone jack is a plusOreo update availableThe damage policy is reassuring some one who's cracked an expensive phone can relate, I have had friends who've gotten their damged one plus devices replaced at their door step with 24hoursI'm totally sold. And really satisfied with my purchase"
Excellent phone,Excellent phone.. Amazing battery life. Superb built quality. Basic accessories like back cover and tempered glass already provided..is a big plus point. The OS is extremely fluid.. Camera is to be fallen in love with..Just that face unlock doesn't work in dark. Needs improvement.. Otherwise is extremely quick in 99% of the cases..OnePlus should come out with no cost emi option for 9 or 12 months also apart from the current 3 months.. This would enable everyone to get access to it.
Super se Uper,"It's simply best phone in this budget, face unlock is super se uper, you hardly need to use fingerprint scanner. Overall experience is too fluid, camera is best. Depth effect feels artificial sometime, else works great. Charging is supery fast, it took harcly hour to full charge it. Case bundled is cool and good gesture by One Plus.One star less coz no oreo update, nor promised exact date when it will come."
Good option I made to switch from an iPhone.,"This phone is really a good choice that stands out in performance with the given price point. Moreover I have been an iPhone user for last 8 years and this phone did not give me any hard time in deciding to switch to Android. Also the performance is very good to meet iphones standard of performance or looks. My Android auto works well, my Google chrome cast integrates well, and there are really few more advantages that I am enjoying day to day. Battery level is really really great. I would always carry my charging cable when I had iPhone 6s and now this stands easily for more than a day with even extensive usage. And charging time is from 10-100% happens in 1hr or 1hr 10mins. In overall I love this phone"
Five Stars,
Awesome phone. I love this phone but the delivery ...,"Awesome phone.I love this phone but the delivery is irritating.Pros:Good rear cameraAwesome displaySuper performance and speedOne of the fastest face detection, fingerprintSuper fast chargingCons:Worst delivery... received the package which is damaged. chances that phone may also get damaged. Impolite serviceFront camera is ok but not great"
Fabulous phone no issue,"This phone is so brilliant that it did not have single cons. I had replace this with my iphone and after that I am very happy. Much much better and advance than iphone. Superb camera, speed, muti tasking, Android edge, screen, light weight and many more. A perfect value for money phone."
Beauty and Beast,Bought 8/128 on prime sale. Unboxing and feeling the phone is awesome. Premium look and finesse.Performance.!!.it simply wows you every time you open the device.Facelock has some issues in my phone..maybe updates will fix...but I prefer fingerlock.. superfast.Camera .. great pics in low light..and awesome Colors.Dashcharge... nothing can beat this..Above all value for your money. (Same features iPhone cost you one lac).A powerful beautiful premium beast in your hand.No second thought to buy the upcoming any OnePlus device.
Excellent phone for 33k,"So the phone is awesome. There are other reviews with technical details, so will skip that bit.I bought the 6/64gb option. It works great and don't feel the need for the more expensive 8/128.The look and feel of the phone is good, feels premium and has full screen available which is great. For the same size as 1plus3 I get more screen.Fingerprint scanner is at the back, takes a little time to get used to.The OS is slick and light weight and is a breeze to operate.Camera is much improved although the selfie could have been better. It's not the best camera but much better than previous versions.Charger has become very bulky and is huge.Other than that, the phone is superb and probably the best value for money at this price.I am still trying to figure how to open the kotak account to get the 1yr insurance free."
Go for it.. excellent product.,"This is my first OP product. In simple words 'Impressed'. Face ID was initially detecting with even closed eyes , but the issue got resolved on software updation..Pros are many .. lightning fast,excellent display,no heating at all,good call clarity,finger print scanner is at perfect place,speaker clarity and volume the best I have experienced.camera is performing the job well.. face ID works even at low lights..Battery lasts for a day average.."
Awsome phone!!!!!???,"MY REVIEW AFTER USING THE PHONE FOR MORE THAN 3 WEEKS.Very happy with the purchase till now everything works fine as promised.The best part about the phone is the dash charging... I never really mind charging every now and then because the battery lasts for the whole day on normal usage and even if charge gets over it only takes half an hour to charge it back up to a decent percentage so i don't worry about charging a lot.Camera also works great. Not the very best but definitely works alright for me. Portrait mode works very well. But i do notice a lot of noice in low light condition. I don't know if its a normal thing in phones but i did notice that so just saying it as it is.And the performance is... how do i put it ""extremely good"". Apps load faster than the speed of light?. Software experience is also awsome. I used to use nova launcher prime on my previous device and had planned to use the same on my op5t but oxygenOS was good enough for me so i sticked to that instead.I do notice a few software glitches here and there though for e.g. swiping down from the top of the screen for notification bar is a hit or miss most of the time. Swiping down does not always gets me to the notification bar . So i do struggle with it at times. Also while typing on gboard sometimes i accidentally tap on multitasking button so it breaks my consistency during typing. This never happened before in my previous phone, maybe it's my bad ,but that's that.But these problems would probably get fixed in the future updates and it doesn't bug me that much anyways so it's not a big deal .Overall I would like to say that this is definitely an awsome phone for the price range. But if water resistance and 4k screens are a priority for you then i would suggest to spend some more cash for better phones. LG v30+ is a good bet i think and apparently pixel 2 phones are also available at 49k now.So if you think you could spend that much, then go for these phones instead but for 33k i can surely say that one plus5t won't disappoint you. ?"
"A clean and Powerful phone, which won't let you down","After using multiple Redmi Phones, I decided to get flagship experience. I really liked the performance and in extreme conditions the phone showed it's awesomeness.Even it has a lot of positive reviews all over the YouTube but I will try to give you some cons which I thought that you should know before buying this phone.The first thing is the camera which should have a Lil better. The camera has very real dynamic colours as well as it performs really well in auto HDR but in low light conditions, the details are lost.Oneplus has improved camera performance after recent update and they are continuing the effort to make it more like a true flagship performer.Using it in reading mode gives me pleasure because the amoled screen looks brilliant in black and white and it gives less stress on eyes also.Overall I would give a thumbs up to this phone and the present referral program program add Icing into the cake you could add use my coupons to get extended warranty I am enclosing it as a snapshot.On successful referral of both the codes you can earn up to 6 months Extended Warranty.Post the offer period, both the referrer and referee will receive a confirmation e-mail confirming the activation of the extended warranty as applicable by March 31, 2018.Coupon code for use on purchase of OnePlus 5T (Midnight Black 6GB RAM + 64GB memory): 65SD-B6LG4H-ZQHAU2Coupon code for use on purchase of OnePlus 5T (Midnight Black 8GB RAM + 128GB memory): FZ8Z-ARLN79-A3VG8R"
The Best phone in this price range..!!,"You might think 33K is a huge money,yes it is a huge amount for some but its totally worth it.We get a superb phone with a?Very decent display,the colors are vivid with its sAMOLED display?It has the snapdragon 835 inside.Its so fluid with the oxygen OS inside?The speaker is very loud?The charging speed is extremely fast.dash charging charges my phone in just 1 hour.?The highlight its camera.it dosent have the standard of iphone X, google pixel 2 or galaxy note 8 but for its price range it is awesome?On paper its just 3300 mah but it lasts me for a day easily?It looks superb in its 18:9 ratio display?Fingerprint sensor is lightning quick?Face recognition is scary fast.you have to use it to understand what I am saying aboutWe compare this phone with google pixel 2 and iphone X.The phones mentioned have double the price by paying double the price we just get a better display and a better camera thats it,so i recommend all to take this phone"

This phone is one of the best available in the Indian Market,"This phone is one of the best available in the Indian Market. I exchanged my MotoG4 plus for this and got additional ?5,700/- off. And ?1500/- off the using my HDFC card. So cutting the long story short, I purchased this phone around ten days back at 25,800/- only. You get a protective scratch guard and a silicon back case with it. I have already ordered a sturdy case and a tempered glass for this, since the scratch guard will only protect it from scratches. No headphones provided. Dash Charger is a beast and fully charges your phone in an hour. Battery lasts me an entire day. The phone does not heat up while charging. Photo quality is excellent. Being a blogger, I always need good quality photographs for my blog. Loving the time lapse option for videos. However, the zoom quality is not upto the mark. Display is mind blowing. Face recognition technology is superb! I would say, for people having ?30,000/- as your budget, go for it. 64GB RAM and processor speed makes the experience smooth."
"Its been a month, Very good phone","Its been a month, I migrated from Redmi, One plus is really Amazing the only problem i do see is the camera lens is kept bulky so the lens may get scratches when you keep it on a table or a rough surfaceSuper fast face unlock, superfast fingerprint sensor, super camera effectsVery good phone, I am having 64 GBversion"
Camera not impressive for this cost,"`I got this phone in a box with  damaged corners but amazon delivery agent justifies that all boxes came in same wayLove this phone for its 6'inches awesome display but  the camera is not much impressive ëven after the latest build, portrait mode is lagging for 2 secs after every clickCons:Default SMS app is not working to send messages if the contact number has country code associatedSelfie mode portrait is not available (I am not aware of this before ordering so want to let people know)Camera is poor in low light and only portrait photos looks impressivePortrait mode is lagging, you have to wait for 2 secs after every click , this happens in 5T only"
Five Stars,Awesome cameraAwesome speed
its just the greed for a latest beauty like 5t. Do not have a second thought,This is my 3rd one plus phone after 2 & 3.. i wasn't attracted to 5.. but 5t made me go for it.. even though the need of a new phone did not rise in me considering the one plus 3 i own(absolutely flawless).. its just the greed for a latest beauty like 5t.Do not have a second thought.. this phone is worth buying and has a life time using capability.. unless u get tempted for a new one..
No other phone compares to the OnePlus,Ok..do this phone is so much better than the inflated iPhone for a fraction of the price.. perfect camera for this who love photography and the best part about it for me is the ability to click the picture by just touching the fingerprint sensor on the back.. a lot of thought has gone into the design of this phone and it's paying off
Worth the price,"I used a single camera phone before this. And i am pretty impressed with the dual camera performance.Phone works smoothly and most of the games i have played has been glitchless. With 128gb memory and gigantic 8gb ram it is a monster indeed. I won’t have to worry about storage space anymore. Yippee!!!18:9 screen is a bliss, watching movies or any media on it feels lifelike and bigger with respect to the phone size.Face unlock feature is great and work very well, I seldom use my fingerprint scanner to unlock. It is that good!! Unlocks in less than half a second. Actually as soon as i look at it.Got a silicone cover and screen guard pre-applied, kudos to that!! Thanks oneplus.And about the fast charging, I can’t stop getting amazed by the speed. (Actually found somewhere that fast charging affects your battery’s lifespan adversely) but who cares. It works like magic, and it is not a software tweet, you can tell by seeing at the charging brick, It is massive (yes, it really is).Only one downside for the package is , they don’t ship it with the Earphones. That is the only downside to the package. But overall it is a great great product.Camera 5/5Screen 4.5/5Look and feel 4/5Processing power 5/5"
"Its a ""Captain America"". Trust OnePlus and go for 5T(128 GB)  blindly","The best phone I have ever used. Its is a ""Captain America"". Too Fast, too Strong, too intelligent. Vexed with my past experiences, here are few things I'd like to share about OnePlus 5T -( 8GB RAM | 128 GB ).1. The feels a stronger than Motorola, Nokia. HTC, Blackberry, Sony, Mi, Apple, Oppo, Samsung - Its a classy looking rough and tough device.2. Connects with - Wifi, Bluetooth, 3G, 4G etc - faster than Blackberry.3. Processing speed - Needless to specify the speed of re-opening apps - Minimize an app, open it after 72 hours - App opens as if it was never closed. I've installed a thousand apps, opened, closed, reopened ans so on. It will never disappoint you. Thanks to SnapDragon 835 and 8GB RAM.4. Dash Charging and Battery - 90% in 60 min - 36 hours minimum in full charge on not-so extensive usage. No more worry of battery, And NO heating problem at all. Even if you operate it under sun.5. Display - The BEST6. Camera - 20+16 Main - 16 Front - Works as expected during day - Portrait mode feels great. I can observe grains on the screen and there's a focus problem in  low-light. Slightly, disappointed by its performance during night.7. Sound Speakers -5 Star ( and no heating problem)8. Fingerprint scanner - Unlocks within less than an eye-blink.- If you want a high-end phone, this phone is the highest you can get. That too at 37,999 /- .- If you are confused between Mi Mix2, Pixel 2, iPhone 8,X, Samsung S8, 5T etc. Go with OnePlus 5T blindly. This beast has a Dual-Sim facility and still have an audio jack, besides all the top  geatures."
This is the best phone in the market where you get so much ...,"This is the best phone in the market where you get so much of value at moderate price. The face unlock of OnePlus 5T is insane and works super fast. Pro Mode in Camera is also a plus point and control over the shutter speed, iso, white balance makes photography fun. The transparent rubber case that comes along with the phone is good and helps you prevent serious damage to your phone."
Excellent! Power button placed wring side for me but.,The phone is excellent. Picture quality and speed everything is excellent. But I have an issue with the placement of power button. It is exactly where I hold with my left hand and many times I invariably end up switching off the screen or shutting off the phone completely if I am not paying attention. I would have preferred it to be on the other side. I switched from iPhone 7 and loving it so far otherwise.
Probably the best android smartphone in 30K range,"I did some research and shortlisted 2-3 android models: Pixel2, Samsung s8, Oneplus 5TThe 1st two options were very good as well but i was more budget conscious and Oneplus 5T suited me well.Android Experience-very snappy performance, 6GB RAM-already received Oreo update- Very close to vanilla androidDisplay and build quality- Its a good 6"" screen , not as good as S8 or Pixel2 but decent- Slim phone no bezel- Fingerprint sensor on back and face recognition on front side(its super accurate and fast)Battery/Heating- No heating issue at all- Dash charging is very handy- Overall battery backup is decent (lasts for a day)Camera- Surprisingly very good- Pixel2 is best in the market but this one is not bad at all- day time pics are seriously good"

Simply elegant and a wonderful device.,Simply elegant and a wonderful device...I don't see any cons in the phone looking at the price it is available inand thumbs up to ONEPLUS to sell it at the same price as oneplus 5
Worth it!,"It has been 3 days since I've been using this phone and until now, I've got no reason to complain. Pretty satisfied with the phone.Did some stress testing by running high end games such as injustice and asphalt side by side. Opened multiple apps, no lags or anything.Facial recognition is unbelievably fast, fingerprint is cool too.Battery life is awesome, lasts whole day easily even with high usage. Its my third day and I've plugged it into the charging once(although for short intervals I did plug this in my laptop). The dash charger is also pretty fast and charges your phone in a very short duration.So overall thumbs up."
"INSANE , POWERFUL, HANDSOME AND TRUE FLAGSHIP KILLER?","Incredible flagship killer ,ProaStunning displayCrazingly fastCamera is coolOs is attractive and silky smoothBuild quality superbFeel that phones is commendable super slim and light weightConsCamera not wide captures less scenario especially selfie cameraNot Oled displayNo free earphones with the boxNo separate sd card slot not even hybrid simConclusionInsane specs minimal or neglible cons... U will never regret buying thus"
Briefing about Pros and Cons,"It is indeed the best phone in this price bracket or what you call as a ""Flagship killer"".I've been using this since a month and would brief the pros and cons :Pros :1. Better display, you'll notice when you compare a normal image with anyone else's phone. Everything looks really good.2. Amazing camera. I'm sure you'll the camera. Don't depend upon portrait mode on low light though.3. Good speakers, the speakers are loud and smooth.4. FACE ID and Touch ID/Fingerprint is astonishingly fast AF.5. Great bandwith, I got better network signals in my place.6. Extremely FAST AF CHARGING.7. Comes with a headphone jack.Cons :1. Since the phone is a bit big, it might not be much handy for you.2. The midnight black material is way too slippery and catches fingerprints so better put on a cover.3. Battery is average .4. Oreo update hasn't come just yet.Hope I was able to clarify all the pros and cons I noticed."
Outstanding and Great Value !!,"Its an outstanding phone, best ever One plus device.Pros:Outstanding job with Battery, it last so well.Screen qualityRAM 8GB habdles anything you throw at it. Zero lag!!Storage is ample with 128 GB.Dashcharge outstanding.Oxygen OS is turned to best now.Face unlock and finger print unlock is amazing.very premium looks.ConsNoneMay be OIS however excellant EIS covers it up.Very Satisfied, suggest 128GB variant as you are future ready for at least three years."
Beast within a Beauty.,"Absolute best in this price range. i bet u wont find anything like this in market.build quality is awesome, hardware is of a beast and looks are of a beauty. NO lags whatsoever. camera quality is also very nice.Support and updates from ONEPLUS are very good.Must buy for those who love big screen with performance of snapdragon 835 & 8 gb ram."
OnePlus 5T rocks,"I was a apple lover.  And used almost every model of iPhone.  But this time I shifted to OnePlus 5T.Wow! What a phone.  It's seriously a beautiful work by the engineers.  Everything is just up to the mark.  The camera is awesome the phone battery last for more than a day. No more lacking of the device, it's smooth, super awesome screen.  Just if it would have a stereo speakers and the earphones then it would be 100 out of 100 for me.  Now it just 99..I hope I would get a good service from the OnePlus team.Thanks"
Premium Handset,"Buy if you are looking an all-round Android phone..Supports heavy gaming, photography(take superb low light pictures) and apps( RAM management is awesome).**Display is just wow. SUPER sensitive and produce sharp images. The 18:9 screen ratio is just perfect for watching movies!!***Has reading mode to read books(helpful those who use Kindle app) without putting any stress on the eyes.* Battery life is commendable..last a day on heavy usage.***One of the issues- protruding rear camera lenses : please be careful while placing the phone on hard surfaces. Also the phone design is slick- use a good back cover!!!***********No earphones in the accessories************ Not water resistant and scratch proof.  Although, it comes with Gorilla Glass 5, few accidental low - level drops won't do any damage to the screen.Using this beast for a month and found no other issues than I mentioned here. Just enjoy the ultimate experience.Peace out!!"
Best Upgrade ever!!!,"Best Smart Phone ever:1) Best Processor.2) Camera is Excellent (especially portrait mode), however low light feature needs to improve because photos still has noises.3) Battery lasts for a day considering that I use Jio 4G, through the day.4) Delivery was apt.5) Light weight as well.6) Charging is so fast, i have not seen a faster charger.7) Overall the best I can have considering I moved from Moto X Play"
finger print unlock and the face unlock which is super super quick,"Reviewing after using for 15 days,Let's begin with the unlock, one gets three options for unlocking the phone, the regular pin code, finger print unlock and the face unlock which is super super quick, it's faster then the S8 and iPhone X, though I phone X unlock is better in dark, 5T doesn't open when it's dark,Ram- I am using the 6 GB version, which I think is more then enough, it doesn't lags at all, you can check the speed test comparison with other phones in YouTube.Camera- the portrait mode, pro mode is amazing, the only Android phone camera better then 5T is the pixel 2.Overall it's the best Android phone absolute on market at this price."
Really! its a Flagship KILLER...,One of the Best Phones i have ever used. The Software is too Fluid and the RAM management is top notch. One of the best buys under 35k.Even if u open 10 tabs Simultaneously all the tabs will be in memory even if u open them after 20 mins.Thank you Oneplus for the great device.
Photos captures in low light are not at all good.,"Placement of Volume rocker on the left side and power button on the right is very inconvenient. Every time I press power button, volume rocker also gets pressed causing volume settings to change unintentionally.Photo captures in low light are not at all good."
Awesome phone in every sense,"Loved this phone. I  don't need to review this because, already so many people have said so much good about this phone. Everything is good camera, battery backup, charging time, screen, looks etc. If you have that much money in your pocket, this is the phone you must choose,"
Battery is good enough. 4/5 2,"Pros :1. Battery is good enough. 4/52. Dash Charging is awesome. 4.5/53. Low Light Photography is Super. 4/54. Performance is good. 4.5/55. Cameras are good. 3.5/5Cons :1. Battery is good enough could be much better.2. Dash Charging is awesome but charges slowly after 90%3. Low Light Photography is not great in all lighting conditions.4. Pictures sharpness and details are poor with some painting effects sometimes.5. Even though powered with high end processor it is not blazing fast when loading apps.6. Easily gets dust and Color goes off not a great finish.Verdict : Everything is Good but Color Fades and Goes Off, could be a better Finish"
No words for it- simply awesome,"Amazing phone. Using it for more than one year now. Key features that makes it a standout - Perfect screen size vis-a-vis phone dimensions (e.g. many 5.5 inch phones are of same size almost but this gives higher screen size on the same phone area) } Camera is outstanding (both front and back with flash) | 8 GB RAM and 128 GB ROM - you dont need anything for couple of years now - fill it up as much as you can , use all the apps in parallel and the speed isnt droppingPrice is perfect for this rangeFinally, the touchsensor and face detection is just awesome ! Nuff said"
Best flagship at this price point...!,Excellent mobile phone at price point...! As I was an IOS user in the past and for my personal experience this mobile doesn't disappoint me in any aspect... If anyone looking for phone with pure Android experience and No lag interface and with good processing power I personal recommend people to buy this phone...! Only negativity is no IP67 rating for water n dust proof...! Other than than it's worth it...!
Review after 15 days of using phone,Amazing phone !!!1. Great Camera2. Fast face unlock and finger print scanner3. Great performance no lag what so ever4. Dash charging works great5. Beautiful displayI am using this phone after using iPhone 6sPlus for 2 yearsAnd i have not mistaken about going for this phone.
Lightning fast is an understatement,"The phone works in a blaze. Of course. The juggernaut has 8GB ram on a snapdragon processor. The camera is beyond par the best camera available in android market. The only time Oneplus will slow a bit down would be when its rendering 4k videos (but hey, so do your heavy built laptops. And besides, how many times in a month do you actually render a 4k video?) . Although I-phone X does win in a VERY few aspects, a point to remember is that jitna dono phone ke prices mei farq hai utne mei ek naya I phone 7+ aa jaayega. Oneplus is worth every buck. It comes along with a cover and an already installed screenguard which means you save another 600-1000 bucks. Headphones? Try skullcandy, work like butter with the phone."
Good flagship,"The phone is good, performance is good, speed is good, no heating issue and battery life is excellent. But, only thing I have disappointed is facial unlock. as mentioned in the description, ""Just look and unlockFacial Recognition-Unlock by just looking at the device; fast fingerprint sensor which unlocks in under 0.2 seconds."", we have to turn on the phone then only is is unlocking thru Facial Recognition."
"One Word -"" THE BEST PHONE I HAVE EVER USED TILL NOW ""","Super value for money . The best flagship killer phone .PROS :-  Awesome Display , Killer Looks , Super Awesome Sound via speakers , Fake Scanner Rocks and interface is buttery smooth and super dash charger is charging my phone from 10% to 80% in 30 mins. ONLYCons :- Battery backup is average BUT it will easily last through complete one working day."
Writing After heavy usage [BEAST],"Purchased on release date and received within a day. After heavy use I'm writing this, phone was awesome in overall. less time on charge and more time on hands and I tried playing some heavy games system works absolutely fine no issue found and main important thing is no heating issue.. Camera: Soo responsive and loving the protriat mode.. Soo guys you can go for it... :)"
Buy it forget everything else... It's dat gud,Loving it.. much faster so much smoother. I still haven't gotten used to the large screen and sometimes the notification tab drops down when I accidentally brush my finger against the sensor. The phone did hang and restart once when I switched on Bluetooth for transferring. Did not try to replicate. The camera is also quite good and gives a nice touch in the portrait mode. On closer look one can definitely note the software portraiting and not hardware. I am not a music guy so no comment on the head phone area. The speaker is loud enough but I feel the ear piece is bit dampened. Display is also really crisp. No complaints on that section.All in all it's worth a buy. For 39000 it's by far the best phone I have had.
Awesome.. just go for it,Excellent mobile.8gb ram and 128 internal memory with snapdragon chipset makes this mobile  fast and unique.Facial unlock is superb. Very fast.Very slim in design.Display is good. Audio output is good comparably. camera is awesome. Charging is fast.Other popular brand will sell this config mobile for more than 80k. Worth for money.I would recommend it. Just go for it.
Awesome phone,"Awsome is the word. Good camera, while in low light it clicks some ok photos. Playing games awesome. Face unlock and finger unlock too is the fastest. Awesome screen. Thank you Amazon and OnePlus for bringing this mobile."
Great Value for Money,"Excellent display. No lags whatsoever.The minimalistic bezel is a great plus in n terms of the design. Great value for money.However, the camera is a bit disappointing. Photos are not that great as compared to those captured in Google Pixel / iPhone X."
Amazing Product with all the specifications at this price,Amazing Product with all the specifications at this price.. no other mobile comes with snapdragons 835 processor at this price. Face unlock is very secure and is very fast.. How ever there are also some deficiencies in the product like1. No front flash for night time selfies2. Phone is not water resistant3. Camera quality not as great as expected4. Battery capacity should have been more
Amazing buy.,Amazing buy... The phone is just too fast and the Amoled display just lights up the phone.Camera is too amazing. The portrait mode provides such great depth to photos that you can't stop clicking them.Video Slo-Mo is great too.The Snapdragon processor 835 is inarguably the best. No heating issues and in fact everything works so smooth.Sleek design makes it look so elegant in your hands. Its a MUST BUY.
Value for money.,The first thing I love in this the screen.I think this the best value for your 33k.Everyone review channel mentioning wireless charging in this device but I think we don't need that charging because my device charge it full in one hour and around.The best thing about 5t is rear camera set up. But about disappointment from front camera because it won't capture in wide angle.But overall it's an amazing devise till now experience.
Awesome phone. My previous phone was MI Max,"Posting this review after all most 1 month use. I bought it early prime sale. Awesome phone. My previous phone was MI Max. That was quite big phone.. but I love 5T, user friendly easy to handle. I can feel the change. Only problem which I'm facing sudden app close, I don't no whether it is hardware problem or apps. Becoz of this I'm giving 4 starts. Cameras are awesome, front facing camera is amazingly clear."
This is an amazing phone with no bloatware unlike others,"Have been a Samsung user throughout before switching to one plus. This is an amazing phone with no bloatware unlike others. I am happy and amazed with the phone with regards to the battery, design and almost everything. One plus has a dedicated team who hears community and work on creating a phone that user wants unlike big brands who works to make more money. Would definitely recommend this phone without a second thought."
Great delivery and exchange experience!,"Recieved the product within 18 hours, and exchange was hassle free. Have only been using the phone for a couple of days now but so far so good! Have only charged the phone for 20 mins in the past 2 days, and the battery is going strong, which is a huge change from the earlier phone!"
Excellent mobile for now and next year,"I have been using mobile over a month now. As of now per inoovation available in market, this has perfect hardware spec and performance. Particularly camera 3d effect. Amazing! As if DSLR is in hand, love to take pics now. Mobile is very fast may due to optimised hardware and 6gb ram. 6in screen with 5.5 inch traditional mobile size, very handy.. finally it's thin and low weight..great mobile to own for next 3 yrs, provided Oreo and Android 9 updates are available.."
Best for the price.,"Bought this after exchanging the OP3. I think the display is what makes this phone absolutely magnificent. The battery life is insane! You get minimum 4hrs SOT.It's light, premium and feels good.The camera is average. Yes it is average in low light. To he totally honest, it's bad in low light. Even the portrait is meh. Software updates may improve that."
AWE-INSPIRING PHONE,"The mobile is awesome.I am in love with it.The phone is a value for money.I would recommend anyone to buy it.The phone never hangs, the camera is awesome.All in all a great phone .THE FACE ID IS DOPE. It is too fast.Thanks to my brother kamaleswar gogoi for recommending it."

Awesome Phone!!,"Awesome Phone, very sleek, light in weight, has all the nice features, screen size is good. Face unlock is a breeze!!! works perfectly every time. Only downside (may be for me) is the vibration strength is a bit on the lower side, even set to the strongest, that can definitely be improved, so that we dont miss calls. Else, if you are looking for a 6inch screen and good value for money, this is the phone to buy, not required to compare with any other model at all."
Powerful and beautifully designed,"Good phone... Using from almost about a month... Extreme gaming, extreme surfing and movies.... Beautifully designed and extremely powerfull...Was expecting oroe update in December itself but seems one+ is going to take their time for that..."
Never Settle One Plus,My first one plus device. I got it on first primw day sale and review after 2 day of usage.Battery 9/10Screen 10/10Sound 9/10 (I'm big fan of Dolby atmos sound missing it)Awsome gaming experience.No heating problem.Various LEDs.Fast performance.I'm in love with it.Buy it if your budget is 30-40kYou won't regret.
"Worth every penny for its software, speed and battery. Don't expect too much from camera.",6gb ram model is enough.. If planning to buy 8 gb ram model then take a look at Google pixel 2. In good lighting condition photos are good. You will see the painting effect in some pics.Secondary rear camera is rarely used as it comes in action in low light scenarios.Still it is fastest device in the list.
Just wow??,"I am using this phone around a month now and I am totally amazed by its features. I bought this phone from amazon at a price of 33000 Rupees.Talking about performance, this phone has Snapdragon 835 octa core processor. Multitasking on this phone is very easy and smooth. No lagging issues are there while switching between different apps..."
Good to buy,R you looking for speedy and long battery phone?This is right for youI had one plus one and now one plus five.Very impressive performance and specs
My one plus 5T phone,"I have used other phones like Samsung, Lenovo & Motorola. But this one plus 5T stands apart from all of them. Very smooth performance. Camera is excellent. No warming up of phone even after long time use. I was deciding on to get whether iphone 7 or one plus 5T. But then my choice went to oneplus 5T. Nice phone!"
5T - T for TERRIFIC ?,Hands down it is one of the best phones of 2017..No other phone can match the performance of this device.It's suuuper FAST.. If you're looking for a new phone ? in this price range.. I would clearly recommend you to buy 5T.And pls don't call it FLAGSHIP KILLER.. It is a FLAGSHIP but at Affordable price that's all ??
Has to be the best Android phone out there,"The best thing about the phone is the stock Android experience which doesnt lag during any task. Cameras are good, looks elegant, runs smoothly. I guess thats pretty much anyone wants, so go for it without thinking."
The phone is just awesome and the working very fine,I received the order 1 day early. The phone is just awesome and the working very fine. Its worth every penny you spend on it. Probably the best phone that i have ever used.
Superb Phone at great price,"Excellent camera, super fast processer, excellent screen resolution, colours and clarity. Very light weight phone. Internet browsing in very fast, speakers are good..... Excellent phone to purchase at 33k price.....One Plus has done a fantastic job"
Super,"Simply brilliant. Display is great, performance even better but what I like the most is the dash charge, especially given I am upgrading from OnePlus one. Wish they had bundled a better quality case with it, the curret one catches smudges like a magnet. But surely a flagship killer at less than half of what a lesser specced, unnecessarily hyped premium phone costs."
"Best phone, I have ever used till now","Best phone , I have ever used till now.To fast in processing, camera is awesome, battery lightening charging. What else you can expect out of this phone.mow onwards one plus will be my choice when it comes to mobile.dont even think twice if u r planning to buy."
The BEST phone out there!!!,"True value for money if u want a premium smartphone at this price!!!It's fast, responsive and the camera is too good.Facial unlock is just wow and unlocks the device very quickly.Dash charge is a blessing and u have a day's long battery within no time."
One plus 5t and note 8 are awesome and I have both,"I have a note 8 deep sea blue 128gb, but my star wars one plus 5t is awesome as well."
Go for it.. Happy clicking !!,"Feedback in A.in way.. really liked the customer obsession as it got delivered before estimated date. Buying this phone is such a great experience especially camera n interface , didn't like the face recognition for unlocking phone as it sometimes won't work. With the dash charger , the phone will get charge in an hr around.. fabulous tech exp it iss!! Amazing phone in this price range..Go for it !!"
Awesomeness in a sexy package!,"Wow. Just plain and simple.. wow! Had a one plus X before this, bought the 5t on exchange and man oh man am I floored by the performance and capabilities of this phone. The camera especially is amazing, much better than the 3t"
Powerful and elegant,Moved from iPhone to one plus . Was bit apprehensive in the beginning but now I have started to like it . Battery backup is way better than iPhone and easily lasts a day . Camera is awesome and outdoor shots are equivalent to any mid level DSLR. Overall happy so far .
